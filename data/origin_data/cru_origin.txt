LATIN NAMES  Bulbillomyces farinosus  (Bres.) Julich^  Persoonia 8(1): 69. 1974
ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  The most obvious feature is the crowded white granules less than 0.1cm across which represent the sclerotial stage, usually on wood. They range from spherical to nearly spherical or pear-shaped. These are more often seen than the sexual stage which consists of thin, soft, waxy, greyish patches tightly attached to wood in wet places.^ The white sclerotia float away on the water and are dispersed widely when the water level falls again. "It can often be seen in localities that are submerged for a period of a month or more in the autumn or in the early spring, but are dry most of the summer.", (Eriksson(4)). Breitenbach(2) say the granules in the photograph [which is of fresh material] are about 0.01-0.02cm. Eriksson(4) say "reaching 0,4 in diam., when dried smaller". This could mean mm, but their photograph of living material with a 1 centimeter scale shows white granules that reach 0.2cm. RANGE The photographs were taken in BC. Collections are deposited from BC at the University of British Columbia. There is a New York Botanical Garden record from WA in 1929. Bulbillomyces farinosus is also known from ON, MA, MO, NH, NY, UT, and VA, (Ginns(5)), as well as Europe (including Switzerland) and Asia, (Breitenbach(2)). It is also found in Scandinavia (Eriksson(4)) and the British Isles (Buczacki(1)).

FRUITING BODY  sexual stage spread out on the surface of wood, tightly attached, "forming thin, crustose patches several centimeters in extent, surface smooth to slightly verrucose, gray-ocherish", margin +/- thinning out; consistency "waxlike and soft when fresh"; sclerotia stage, also known as Aegerita candida Pers.: Fr., consists of crowded, pear-shaped, white granules about 0.01-0.02cm across, and is more frequently seen than the sexual stage^, (Breitenbach), resupinate, adnate, usually 0.01-0.03cm, rarely thicker, "margin indeterminately thinning out in young specimens, in mature fruitbodies varying after circumstances but often more determinate"; grayish watery white and waxy when wet and alive; "smooth but under the lens more or less finely papillose and besides pilose by the projecting cystidia"; sclerotia round to nearly round, "like small eggs, in the living state reaching 0,4 in diam., when dried smaller, at first scattered on the wood then close together, loosely attached, pure white when alive", (Eriksson)
HABITAT  found on wood or bark (Acer, Alnus, Fagus, Populus, Ulmus, Pinus), or on ground, mostly in very wet places, (Ginns(5)), on "the undersides of stumps and on wood of broadleaved trees lying on the ground, in damp, periodically flooded places in lake- and streamside woods", spring and fall, (Breitenbach)^, on "decayed, soaked wood on shores of lakes and brooks or in depressions which are water-filled during wet periods", (Eriksson)

ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  Helminthosphaeria clavariarum forms a gray to black coating on Clavulina coralloides (caused by formation of their minute fruitbodies), seeming to reduce branching of the tips of the Clavulina, (Trudell). It is found on fruitbodies of Clavulina coralloides (as C. cristata) and C. cinerea, (Dennis). Black dots may be observed in the coating under a hand lens and are visible in larger digital images.^ The conidial state, which may be found without perithecia, has been called Spadicoides clavariarum. RANGE Helminthosphaeria clavariarum on fruitbodies of Clavulina coralloides has been vouchered from WA (for instance WTU-F-000133 as Clavulina cristata from WA at the University of Washington, by S. Trudell). It is casually reported more widely on sight in the Pacific Northwest including BC, and a parasitized collection of Clavulina coralloides (as Clavulina cristata) from BC is at the Pacific Forestry Centre. 
FRUITING BODY  perithecia about 0.03cm across, "scattered over a web of dark brown hyphae, superficial or somewhat embedded in the mat", subglobose [nearly spherical], without a distinct papilla; black, covered with spreading hairs^, (Dennis)
HABITAT  on fruitbodies of Clavulina coralloides (as C. cristata) and C. cinerea, (Dennis)
MICROSCOPIC  spores 10-14 x 6-7 microns, broadly fusiform or one-sided, dark brown, non-septate, uniseriate^; asci 8-spored, up to 90 x 8 microns, cylindric, stalked; paraphyses numerous; some hairs tapering to a point, others cylindric and bearing elliptic, 1-septate, brown conidia, (Dennis)
NAME ORIGIN  means 'of Clavarias'
SIMILAR  It may be difficult to distinguish Clavulina cinerea macroscopically from parasitized collections of Clavulina coralloides. There is an excellent discussion of this problem in Kuo(7). Helminthosphaeria clavariarum parasitizes both species from the base upwards, rendering them gray to black. 'Under a hand lens, the tiny black dots that form the perithecia of the pyrenomycete can be seen' and under the microscope the differences are obvious. The black dots may be seen on larger digital images. Most Clavulina cinerea fruitbodies, as presented in field guides and on the Internet, 'display grayish to purplish gray (not dark gray or black) colors on the branches and paler surfaces near the base of the mushroom, suggesting that the gray surfaces above do not represent the influence of the parasite, which attacks from the base upward.'. 'However, even if Clavulina cinerea does not (usually) represent parasitization of Clavulina cristata, it may still merely represent a gray and frequently less cristate form or "ecotype" of the latter', (Kuo(7) with Latin names italicized).

FRUITING BODY  resupinate, effused [spread out], adnate [firmly attached]; creamish white to cream yellow, when postmature pale ochraceous; at first smooth with sparse, small, conic aculei [spines], "which then grow bigger and denser but practically always with easily visible smooth hymenium between the aculei, the subicular hymenium at first porose, then almost continuous"; tips of spines finely penicillate [brush-like] under 50x lens from projecting cystidia, especially in young fruitbodies; margin when young indistinctly thinning out, then more determinate [well demarcated]^, (Eriksson), resupinate, tightly attached, forming thin, membranous-crustose patches several centimeters to decimeters across, consistency soft, chalky; white to cream, also ocher-brownish when old; "arachnoid-smooth when young, then with scattered papillae and when fully grown with distinct, short and pointed, fringed spines, between the spines always with visible smooth subiculum"; margin thin, (Breitenbach), spines up to about 0.05cm long (Langer)

NAME ORIGIN  means 'granulose'
SIMILAR  Hyphodontia breviseta has somewhat smaller spores and a different arrangement of spines: while as a rule these are +/- far apart in H. granulosa and the smooth hymenium remains clearly visible between them, they are close together in H. breviseta so that the hymenium is almost covered up, (Breitenbach). H. breviseta can be similar but H. granulosa is usually recognizably different due to its whitish even fruitbody with sparse distinct spines and continuous subicular hymenium; however, some forms are close to H. breviseta and then the subtle microscopic differences must be used: H. breviseta has slightly smaller spores and less dense, more distinct hyphae, (Eriksson). Hyphodontia spathulata generally has flattened spines that are longer, and projecting hyphae are somewhat different, (Eriksson).

SIMILAR  Hypocrea americana and Hypocrea protopulvinata are closely related and the habitat is on polypores in both cases. H. americana has part-ascospores that are subglobose to rhomboidal, measuring (1.7)2.63.8(6.2) x (2.4)3.24.2(5.4) microns. Collections were examined by Overton(1) from AZ, NH, NM, and NY. Hypocrea protopulvinata has dimorphic smooth spores with the distal part nearly round, (3)3.3-3.9(4.3) x (2.6)3-5(4.2) microns, and the proximal part elliptic, sometimes nearly round, (3.2)3.6-4.2 (4.8) x (2.4)2.7-3.3(3.8) microns. Collections were examined by Overton(1) from MD, NY, OH, and Japan. Hypocrea citrina (Pers: Fr.) Fr. sensu Overton et al. is also closely related but is white to yellow and grows flat on leaf litter, soil, bark, or moss. The part-ascospores have spinulose ornamentation, with the distal part nearly round, sometimes subelliptic, (3.2)4.1-5.2(6.3) x (2.9)3.7-4.8(5.7) microns, and the proximal part elliptic, sometimes nearly round to ovate, (3.3)4.4-6(7.1) x (2.5)3.3-4.9(6.3) microns. H. citrina has been reported from the Pacific Northwest but the sense is unknown: the name has often been used with the synonym Hypocrea pulvinata to cover both fruitbodies that grow on polypores and those that grow elsewhere. Collections were examined by Overton(1) from GA, KY, NC, NY, OH, and Europe, and the range includes Japan. Hypocrea rufa has been reported by Oluna Ceska from British Columbia (collections at the University of British Columbia) and a collection from Washington is at the New York Botanical Garden. Fruitbodies are red-brown (with the margin white when young), hemispherical to plate-like, and grow on damp wood or wet bark, or occasionally on old fungi or other plant remains. Hypocrea gelatinosa has cushions up to 0.2cm with dark green spots (because of spores) on a pale yellowish background and grows on wood. Hypocrea aureoviridis has disc-shaped bright yellow to brownish fruitbodies up to 0.5cm across, and also has dark green spots. Both of these have been reported from British Columbia by Oluna Ceska (collections at the University of British Columbia). O. Ceska has also deposited at the University of British Columbia a collection from British Columbia of Hypocrea moravica on a rotting branch of Alnus rubra (on bark and branchlet portions). Hypocrea patella has yellow plate-like fruitbodies on wood (with a definite border) - collections from British Columbia at the University of British Columbia are identified as this species.

LATIN NAMES  Hypomyces chrysospermus  Tul.  group^  Ann. Sci. Nat. Bot. IV. 13: 16. 1860;  == Apiocrea chrysosperma  (Tul.) Syd. & P. Syd.;  = Hypomyces boletinus  Peck
ENGLISH NAMES  bolete-eater, golden bolete-eater
NOTES  This taxon is designated as a group so that it includes Hypomyces microspermus (see separate description) which is difficult to distinguish and was at one time considered a small-spored form of Hypomyces chrysospermus. The descriptions below are specific to Hypomyces chrysospermus itself except probably for Arora's. Features include 1) a three stage mould-like growth on fungi of Boletaceae, the first white, the second yellow, and the third (seldom seen) red-brown and pimpled, and 2) spores in the white stage that are elliptic, colorless and smooth (conidia), in the yellow stage round, yellow, thick-walled, and warted ("aleuriospores"), and in the final (sexual) stage spindle-shaped, colorless, and usually 1-septate (ascospores).^ Hypomyces chrysospermus is not edible (Arora). The anamorph of H. chrysospermus is common, but the teleomorph is uncommon, (Poldmaa). The commoner anamorph stage of Hypomyces chrysospermus is known as Sepedonium chrysospermum and the anamorph stage of Hypomyces microspermus is a similar Sepedonium. The subicular hyphae in H. chrysospermus are 2-2.5 microns wide but when old many cells become irregularly inflated; in H. microspermus, the subicular cells are 3-5 microns wide. Six other Hypomyces species growing on boletes in the United States are described in Rogerson(1). Like H. chrysospermus and H. microsporus, they start with a white subiculum on the surface of the bolete, but they have a different range of features, including a) the width of the subicular hyphae, b) the color of the subiculum that develops, c) the features of the usually round or nearly round "aleuriospores" of the second anamorph stage, d) the features of the sexual stage, and e) sometimes in the species of bolete involved. The sexual stage is uncommonly observed because by the time it develops, the original bolete and the subiculum is often not evident. RANGE Collections of Hypomyces chrysospermus were examined from NF, ME, NC, NH, NY, Belgium, France, United Kingdom, Japan, Nepal, Australia, and New Zealand, (Rogerson). H. chrysospermus has also been found in NC, Cuba, northern Africa, China, Kazakhstan, and Russia, (Poldmaa), and CA (Siegel). There are collections from BC at the University of British Columbia and from AK at the University of Washington, but there is no indication in the online records that ascospores were measured to distinguish H. chrysospermus from H. microspermus. A collection at the University of Washington from Washington was previously identified as Hypomyces lactifluorum which seems an unlikely confusion. There are two more collections from WA at the University of Washington deposited under the yellow anamorph name Sepedonium chrysospermum, which presumably could represent either Hypomyces chrysospermus or Hypomyces microspermus. Hypomyces chrysospermus may occur more widely in the Pacific Northwest and in other areas of the United States (see Mushroom Observer for instance), but needs to be better documented especially considering the similarity to the common Hypomyces microspermus.
FRUITING BODY  beginning as a white mouldy-looking covering "that attacks and quickly engulfs boletes, then turns bright yellow and powdery", and then finally becomes reddish brown and pimpled (but this final stage rarely seen, only occurring after host is decayed beyond recognition and unpleasant to handle); flesh of bolete "often soft or mushy"^, (Arora), subiculum "at first white, usually becoming golden yellow, remaining white or becoming pink, vinaceous to ferruginous"; perithecia "orange-yellow, brick red, red-brown, or rufous brown, not reacting in KOH, or becoming yellow-brown to red-brown and often with distinctly red coloration at base of papilla, immersed in subiculum except for papilla", (Rogerson), subiculum profuse, texture hyphal, at first white, turning yellow when old (as chlamydospores formed), not changing color in KOH, perithecia "formed all over the subiculum, caespitose, immersed in the subiculum except the papilla", "yellow, brown or red", KOH reaction present or absent (see MICROSCOPIC), (Poldmaa)
HABITAT  on members of the Boletaceae, covering the cap, stem and tube surfaces of the host and filling the tubes; the yellow stage has been reported as Sepedonium "from, in addition to boletes, other fungi including, Rhizopogon, Scleroderma, various agarics, and it has been isolated from the air, soil, dung, etc." but the sexual stage has only been found on boletes^, (Rogerson, genus names italicized), on fungi of Boletales: Boletus, Gomphidius, Gyroporus, Leccinum, Paxillus, Phylloporus, Pisolithus, Porphyrellus, Strobilomyces, Suillus, Tylopilus, Xerocomus, covering host's spore-bearing surface or also host's cap and part of stem, the host fruitbody becomes decayed, (Poldmaa), June to September (Phillips), commonly seen on Boletus zelleri, B. chrysenteron, B. mirabilis, and other boletes, (Trudell)

SIMILAR  Hypomyces microspermus Rogerson & Samuels is "the most frequently collected of the boleticolous species in North America" (whereas H. chrysospermus is "the most frequently reported boleticolous species"). H. microspermus is found at least in CA (Del Norte Co.), eastern North America, Indonesia, and New Zealand. It has ascospores rarely above 15 microns in length, not prominently verrucose, varying from equally bicellular to unequally bicellular, whereas those of H. chrysospermus rarely range below 20 microns in length, are prominently verrucose, and unequally bicellular. Conidia and aleuriospores of H. microspermus averaged somewhat smaller than those of H. chrysospermus but the measurements overlapped. The size of the conidia is given as 11-14 x 4-5 microns and (in culture) as (5)6.4-11.7(14) x (2.5)2.7-4.5(5) microns. The size of the aleuriospores given as 12-15 microns in diameter. (Rogerson).

LATIN NAMES  Hypomyces microspermus  Rogerson & Samuels^  Mycologia 81(3): 426. 1989
ENGLISH NAMES  bolete-eater
NOTES  Features of the usually observed stages are a white mold that gradually covers a recognizable bolete fruitbody, than starts turning bright yellow to golden, the bolete fruitbody often collapsing into decay.^ It is very similar to Hypomyces chrysospermus and we have included it in a Hypomyces chrysospermus group because of the difficulty of telling them apart. In Mushrooms of the Redwood Coast, Siegel(2) say, "This common bolete-parasitic mold goes through two asexual-sporulating stages leading up to the sexual stage, which is rarely observed (the host is often buried in duff by this point)." The sexual stage is a reddish brown, pimply crust (Siegel(2)). The description is from Rogerson(1) except where otherwise specified. RANGE Collections were studied from MA (holotype), CA (Del Norte County in extreme northwest of state), QC, CT, ME, MI, NC, NH, NY, NY, OH, PA, VA, WV, Indonesia, Japan, and New Zealand, (Rogerson). H. microspermus has been reported from PQ, CA, CT, MA, MD, MI, NC, NH, NJ, NY, OH, PA, TN, VA, WV, Germany, Indonesia, Japan, and New Zealand, (Poldmaa).
FRUITING BODY  subiculum "at first white, becoming pale yellow"; perithecia spherical to ovoid, "yellow, buff, deep peach, red, brick red, orange-red, cinnabar red, reddish brown, pale brown, blackish brown when dry, often turning purplish red in 3% KOH"^, (Rogerson), second stage "bright yellow to golden colored"; odor indistinct to putrid, spore deposit white in first stage, golden yellow in second stage, (Siegel)
HABITAT  on many species of the Boletaceae
MICROSCOPIC  SPORES in white stage 5-17 x 3-7 microns, "oblong to broadly elliptic", in yellow stage 8.5-15 microns in diameter, "round, distinctly spiny, very thick walled", in sexual stage 8-15 x 2.5-4.5 microns, "spindle to lance shaped"^, (Siegel), SPORES: CONIDIA 11-14 x 4-5 microns, elliptic, 1-celled, "held in colorless slime heads at tips of macronematous, irregularly to verticillately branched, septate, hyaline conidiophores", ALEURIOSPORES 12-15 microns in diameter, round, wall about 2 microns thick, "usually prominently warted, bright yellow, golden yellow or yellow orange", warts 1-1.5 microns high and often truncate;  ASCOSPORES (8)10-15 x (2.3)3-4 microns, "naviculate, fusiform-ellipsoid", "smooth or verrucose", verrucae less than 0.25 microns high, apiculi less than 1 microns long, bicellular, "septum usually submedian giving two unequal cells" (upper cell 6-8 x 3-4 microns, lower cell (2.3)4-5(6) microns), "sometimes median giving two equal cells, sometimes lacking and ascospores remaining unicellular", spores "uniseriate in the ascus, the ends overlapping"; ASCUS (110)112-120 x 4-6 microns, cylindric to clavate, wall somewhat thickened, with apical pore; PERITHECIA (230)305-315(400) x (180)240-250(330) microns, spherical to obovoid, perithecial wall 20-25 microns wide, cells 6-10 x 2-3 microns, walls less than 0.5 micron thick, papilla 80 microns high and 100 microns wide at base, terminal wall cells 4-7 microns in diameter, +/- clavate; SUBICULAR HYPHAE 3-5 microns wide. (Rogerson)
NAME ORIGIN  "refers to the small ascospores"
SIMILAR  Hypomyces chrysospermus differs most obviously in the ascospores [although these are not often available] which rarely range below 20 microns, "are prominently verrucose, and unequally bicellular", whereas ascospores of H. microspermus rarely range above 15 microns in length, "are not prominently verrucose, and vary from equally bicellular to unequally bicellular". Aleurospores and conidia of H. chrysospermus average somewhat larger, but measurements overlap. (Rogerson(1)). Hypomyces chrysospermus is much less common in California but is "only reliably distinguished by its much larger spores" which measure (10)12-25 microns, (Siegel(2)).

NOTES  Features include 1) a profuse, white, cottony, mould-like growth on Lactarius and Russula, often extending over nearby substrate and rarely forming a white, buff, or orange teleomorph with a pimpled surface (usually after the host is destroyed), 2) up to three types of "spores": a) conidia 11-24 x 7-12 microns, of various shapes, b) chlamydospores (thick-walled cells) about 20 microns in diameter with wall 2 microns thick, and c) when the rare teleomorph is present ascospores that are 2-celled, verrucose, and apiculate.^ The anamorph (Cladobotrum verticillatum (Link) S.J. Hughes) is very common, but the teleomorph is rare, (Poldmaa).

NOTES  Features include 1) a mould-like, cottony growth on many kinds of fungi, especially Aphyllophorales, white becoming rose-colored or red, with dark red pimple-like perithecia, 2) large spores (usually over 30 microns long) that are verrucose and conspicuously apiculate, 3) an anamorph in nature forming a delicate yellowish to red mycelium on which erect conidiophores are standing, each conidiophore bearing a number of conidia at the top that appear as white tufts, and 4) in addition to conidia 18-30 x 8-10 microns, the anamorph produces thick-walled cells (chlamydospores) that are 60-90 x 15-20 microns.^ RANGE Hypomyces rosellus was collected from BC by Kevin Trim (on the underside of Polyporus), It was also reported from BC in Redhead(5). It has been reported from NY, Estonia, Poland, and Ukraine, (Rogerson). It is probably cosmopolitan, with both the teleomorph and anamorph common: there are  records from CA, NY, Cuba, Argentina, Estonia, Lithuania, Portugal, Russia (northwest, Siberia), Ukraine, United Kingdom, Iran, Japan, and New Zealand, (Poldmaa). There is a collection from VA at the University of British Columbia. The M Beug photograph represents a collection that probably came from near Sisters Oregon.

Mycoacia austro-occidentale Canf., found in Arizona, is pale buff to cream, with spores 4.0-4.5 x 2.0-2.5 microns, (Ginns(23)). Mycoacia is separated from other resupinate, odontioid fungi by its wax-like consistency, (Breitenbach).

NOTES  Features of Nectria cinnabarina group include fruiting with many dense clusters (each with a more or less circular outline) of tiny cushion-shaped red to red-brown fruitbodies with an apical papilla, growth on hardwood, and microscopic characters. The pink to light red to light orange cushions of the conidial state (known as 'coral spot') are usually associated. These anamorphs are Tubercularia vulgaris or close spp. |Hirooka(1) examined and sequenced collections labeled as this species and found at least four species: 1) Nectria dematiosa (up to 2-septate ascospores, stemless anamorphs, known from British Columbia, Poland, Japan, and New Zealand), 2) Nectria cinnabarina (up to 2-septate ascospores, anamorph fruitbodies predominantly (70%) long-stemmed, known from eastern North America and Europe), 3) Nectria nigrescens (up to 3-septate ascospores - 4% are 3-septate. 5% 2-septate, anamorph fruitbodies that are 65% short-stemmed and 35% long-stemmed, known from eastern North America and Europe), and 4) Nectria asiatica (up to 1-septate ascospores, anamorph fruitbodies short-stemmed, known from China and Japan). The length of the stems is not specified but the illustration of N. cinnabarina appears to show a stem almost as high at the rest of the fruitbody and almost as wide across as the fruitbody is across. Note that the stems of the stemmed anamorph antibodies may be obscured by masses of conidia so that they appear to be stemless. Note also that there are subclades within N. dematiosa that could represent separate species, but evidence is insufficient. |RANGE There are collections labeled as Nectria cinnabarina at the University of British Columbia from BC, WA, and OR.
FRUITING BODY  individual fruitbodies 0.02-0.04cm, spherical to oval, with a papilla, "resting in dense groups on a cushionlike, somewhat lighter colored stroma which emerges from the bark"; "bright vermilion to brown-red"; surface roughened; "Even more conspicuous is the light orange to pink cushionlike conidial stage Tubercularia vulgaris Tode ex Fr., which in the course of development forms the stroma for the perithecia"^, (Breitenbach, Latin name italicized), 0.04cm across, "densely crowded on a small erumpent, cushion-like, stromatic base"; "cinnabar-red", darkening when old; "minutely warted, each with a small apical, papillate ostiole"; conidial state is pink to light red cushions [also referred to as bright coral-red], (Dennis), perithecia distinctly warty-rugulose, (Hansen, L.)

ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  "Its most noteworthy character, by which it may be recognized at a glance, is its curious habit of forming the fructification on bark-covered limbs between the bark and the wood, so that the loosened bark - very noticeable on Quercus limbs - curls back, disclosing the fructification closely adnate on the wood.", (Burt, hyphen replaced by long dashes and genus name italicized). Other features of Peniophora decorticans include 1) color that is pale pinkish buff and pale gray to whitish, 2) antler-shaped paraphyses and 3) encrusted cystidia, seen only in the region next to the bark.^ The description is derived from Burt(7). It is common locally in Washington and Oregon, (Burt). RANGE It has been found in BC, WA, and OR, (Ginns). 
FRUITING BODY  2-600cm long, 1-2cm wide, flat on substrate, closely attached, "very thin, growing on the wood, spreading longitudinally and laterally between the wood and bark, loosening the latter"; "pale pinkish buff and pale gull-gray to whitish"; pruinose, with occasionally tubercles in some collections

SIMILAR  Phanerochaete sordida and Phanerochaete velutina can be differentiated on the basis of the shape and number of cystidia and the structure of the subiculum hyphae, (Breitenbach), P. sordida and P. velutina have cystidia that are less narrow and less tapering than in P. affinis, (Eriksson), Phanerochaete velutina may be similar and like P. affinis has a fibrillose or cordonic margin, but P. velutina 1) is tan to pale tan to brownish red to burgundy (often with a violet tint), whereas P. affinis is usually orange brown to brownish orange, 2) has cystidia mostly greater than 9 microns wide, whereas those of P. affinis are up to 8 microns wide, and 3) usually possesses white cordons, (Burdsall), Phanerochaete sordida 1) lacks a fibrillose to cordonic margin, 2) is usually less orange than P. affinis, and 3) has a different subiculum: P. affinis has a more compact and somewhat agglutinated subiculum with less rigid-appearing hyphae, whereas P. sordida has a more lattice-like appearance, (Burdsall); Cylindrobasidium laeve can be macroscopically similar, but is easy to separate microscopically, (Breitenbach)

SIMILAR  Phanerochaete affinis can be differentiated on the basis of the shape and number of cystidia and the structure of the subiculum hyphae, (Breitenbach). P. affinis has cystidia that are more numerous, narrower and more tapering than in P. sordida, (Eriksson). P. affinis 1) has a fibrillose to cordonic margin, 2) is usually more orange than P. sordida, and 3) has a more compact and somewhat less agglutinated subiculum with less rigid-appearing hyphae than P. sordida, (Burdsall). Phanerochaete chrysosporium has longer cystidia than Phanerochaete sordida and they are thin-walled and more or less enclosed, (Eriksson(5)). Phanerochaete tuberculata lacks cystidia (Breitenbach). Phanerochaete velutina does not have the lattice-work appearance of the subiculum, its cystidia are wider, and the fruitbody is typically pale tan to dark burgundy brown rather than typically cream-colored, (Burdsall).

SIMILAR  Phanerochaete affinis can be differentiated on the basis of the shape and number of cystidia and the structure of the subiculum hyphae, (Breitenbach). P. affinis has cystidia that are narrower and more tapering than in P. velutina, (Eriksson). P. affinis may be similar macroscopically and like P. velutina has a fibrillose or cordonic margin, but P. affinis 1) is usually orange brown to brownish orange whereas P. velutina is pale tan to brownish red or burgundy (often with a violet tint), 2) has smaller cystidia mostly up to 8 microns wide, whereas those of P. velutina are mostly greater than 9 microns wide, and 3) only occasionally possesses cordons, (Burdsall). Phanerochaete tuberculata lacks cystidia (Breitenbach). Phanerochaete sordida has a lattice-work appearance in the subiculum, cystidia are narrower, and the fruitbody is typically cream-colored, rather than pale tan to dark burgundy brown, (Burdsall).

SIMILAR  Phlebia radiata has practically the same microstructure, but is radially folded, whereas Phlebia rufa is always merulioid-poroid, (Eriksson). Typical specimens of P. acerina [which we treat here as a synonym] have yellowish brown spore-bearing surfaces that are unchanged in KOH, whereas the spore bearing surfaces of P. rufa are reddish brown and turn even darker in KOH. Fruitbodies of P. rufa are generally thinner and less robust than those of P. acerina. The folds in P. acerina are broader, and the margins are usually entire and often detach whereas those of P. rufa are fibrillose and closely appressed. Mature P. acerina often develops "a differentiated subiculum with conglutinated parallel hyphae next to the substrate and a loose upper layer that contains abundant, yellow, amorphous substances", but this is never present in P. rufa. Hymenial cystidia are usually present in P. acerina and are difficult to separate from agglutinated hymenial elements, whereas hymenial cystidia are rare to absent in P. rufa and hymenial elements are not agglutinated and are therefore easier to separate. The spore-bearing surface may be interrupted in P. acerina by "white, felty to woolly mycelia". (Nakasone(10)). See also SIMILAR section of Phlebia tremellosa.

ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  The distinctive feature is the bright yellow-orange rhizomorphs which are seen in the litter or humus layers of acid coniferous forests, more commonly than the fruitbodies. Other features include 1) resupinate growth on rotten wood or other substrates, 2) soft, cottony fruitbodies that are generally yellow (but sometimes whitish), and smooth to slightly tuberculate (fine-pored under a 50x lens), 3) spores that are nearly round, smooth, rather thick-walled, non-amyloid, and colorless, and have one droplet, and 4) a monomitic hyphal system, the hyphae without clamp connections, the basal and rhizomorph hyphae with yellow encrustation.^ Corticium bicolor Peck may be a different species but the name has been used for this species in the past. Furthermore the online Species Fungorum, accessed June 10, 2016, gives the current name of Piloderma fallax (Lib.) Stalpers as Piloderma bicolor (Peck) Julich with Corticium bicolor Peck as a synonym. Piloderma fallax is evidently a common species in the whole of the temperate region of the northern hemisphere, (Eriksson). Not all of the yellow rhizomorphs in the acid forest soils belong to this species but that is by far the most frequent species with bright yellow rhizomorphs, (Eriksson). RANGE Piloderma fallax has been found in BC, WA, OR, ID, AB, MB, ON, PQ, SK, AZ, CA, CO, MA, ME, MI, MN, MT, NC, NH, NJ, NM, NY, PA, and WI, (Ginns). It has also been found in Austria, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Norway, Poland, Sweden, and the USSR, (Julich). It occurs in Switzerland and in Asia, (Breitenbach).

FRUITING BODY  broadly effused [spread out], up to 1.3cm by 0.5cm in extent, possibly larger, waxy when moist, the spore-bearing surface drying horny; "benzo brown" to "cinnamon drab", fading to buff or pallid near the margin; margin broad, thin, fimbriate [fringed], white (no suggestion that margin is ever determinate); spines sparsely and irregularly distributed, (where most abundant, 3-5 per square millimeter), blunt, broad, somewhat fimbriate, white, up to 0.06cm long and 0.035cm across at base, tapering toward tips
HABITAT  on dead wood of Populus trichocarpa (Black Cottonwood), July 26-August 11
MICROSCOPIC  SPORES (9)10-12(13) x (4)4.5-5(5.5) microns, cylindric to allantoid, usually with numerous small droplets, sometimes with 1-3 large droplets and numerous smaller ones, germinating by repetition^; PROBASIDIA spherical to ovate or pyriform, "mostly 13-20 x 9-12 microns, becoming cruciate-septate, each cell producing a thick, rather short epibasidium, 2-2.5(3) microns in diameter"; DENDROPHYSES "3-4 microns in diameter at base, branching subdichotomously several times and irregularly attenuated toward the tips, sometimes with clamp-connections"; spines "fertile over most of the surface, as is the hymenium between them, but the extreme tip is often sterile", "owing to protrusion of an extension of the intermediate yellow layer, giving them a fimbriate appearance when examined dry under a binocular", spines "tend to be borne in lines on whitish strands, which makes the hymenial surface appear faintly reticulate under a lens"; hymenium "composed of colorless basidia and dendrophyses", the latter rather difficult to see since the terminal part does not stain; "in section 65-230 microns thick between the spines, composed of a colorless hymenial layer 20-40 microns thick, a yellowish basal layer of horizontal hyphae and an intermediate layer of variable thickness, clear yellow by transmitted light, which penetrates the spines, composed of indistinct agglutinated hyphae intermingled with crystalline accretions"

SIMILAR  "Steccherinum laeticolor would appear to be well separated from S. ochraceum by several characters, but not all of them are unrelated and one or two may be found to be either underdeveloped or altered by age. One of the characters probably least subject to change is the aspect of the margin", the margin of the effused part in S. laeticolor is fimbriate, and in S. ochraceum is delicately scalloped and evenly velutinous [velvety], (Maas Geesteranus, Latin names italicized), the type of H. laeticolor is similar to Steccherinum ochraceum but lacks hymenial detail, (Ginns), Steccherinum laeticolor 'is certainly very close to the common Steccherinum ochraceum (Fries) S. F. Gray. Banker (1912) considered H. laeticolor, which he placed in the genus Steccherinum S. F. Gray, to differ ". . . by it soft-spongy or almost cotton-like substance and its pronounced reddish color when young and fresh . . . " Miller and Boyle (1943) state that H. laeticolor differs in having slightly larger spores. None of these characters is discernible in the type material.'

NAME ORIGIN  from 'gausapa', meaning 'shaggy, woolen cloth or garment'
SIMILAR  Stereum gausapatum can be distinguished from members of the Stereum hirsutum complex on the basis of 1) pseudocystidial wall thickness less than 1.5 microns (members of the Stereum hirsutum complex have pseudocystidial wall thickness greater than 1.5 microns), other characters that can be helpful are 2) Stereum gausapatum is restricted to Quercus (oak), (members of the Stereum hirsutum complex can grow on oak, but a Stereum specimen on oak is most likely to be S. gausapatum), 3) S. gausapatum usually bleeds or bruises red, while dry hymenia show dark violet or blackish stains instead, (S. complicatum may bruise red, but microscopic examination of radial sections reveal that the conducting hyphae do not possess the brownish contents typical of S. gausapatum - on the other hand S. versicolor, found in Florida and tropical areas, may possess brownish conducting hyphal contents), 4) caps of S. gausapatum are usually radially plicate, 5) the hymenium of S. gausapatum is buff to clay-colored, whereas that of S. hirsutum is yellow to pale orange, (Chamuris(4)); Stereum rugosum has a harder and thicker fruitbody and microscopically has pseudoacanthohyphidia (Eriksson).

NOTES  {See also Stereum Table.} Care must be taken not to confuse this genus with Trametes (see Polypore category), whose underside will reveal pores when examined with a hand lens. Features of Stereum hirsutum include 1) growth on hardwood, and occasionally conifer wood, 2) elastic, tough fruitbody that is semicircular to fan-shaped, usually shingled and forming rows, but may be resupinate, or bent outward from resupinate surface to form a shelf, 3) cap surface that is hairy-tomentose, zoned, yellow-orange to reddish brown with grayish white tomentum, with wavy surface and margin, the margin lobed and lighter in color, 4) spore-bearing surface that is grayish to yellowish, ochraceous, pale orange or orange-brown (with a whitish margin in actively growing specimens), not generally turning red when bruised, 5) spores that are narrowly elliptic to cylindric, smooth, weakly amyloid, and colorless, 6) conducting hyphae ending in pseudocystidia, and also sharp-tipped hyphidia present, 7) 2 types of hyphae, neither with clamp connections: thin-walled to thick-walled and branching, and thick-walled, branching less.^ |Stereum complicatum, Stereum gausapatum, Stereum hirsutum, and Stereum ochraceoflavum are members of the subgenus Stereum, having sharp tipped hyphidia but lacking the pseudoacanthohyphidia found in subgenus Aculeatostereum. The Stereum hirsutum complex according to Welden(4) in 1971, referred to in Chamuris(4) in 1985, includes 1) Stereum hirsutum, 2) Stereum complicatum, 3) Stereum gausapatum (excluded by Chamuris(4) on the grounds that it is easily distinguished), 4) Stereum versicolor (Swartz: Fr.) Fr. (found in Florida and other tropical / subtropical areas), 5) Stereum styracifluum (Schwein.: Fr.) Fr. reported from Alabama and North Carolina, said to be effused or slightly reflexed and bleed yellow, regarded by Chamuris as a synonym of S. hirsutum, and 6) Stereum subtomentosum Pouzar, reported from Northwest Territories, Ontario, and Quebec, said to be effused-reflexed to stemmed and bleed yellow, regarded by Chamuris as a synonym of S. hirsutum, but suspected by Ginns(5) to be a common species, with specimens being misnamed S. ostrea. |The distinctions are sometimes not easy in practice - Welden(4) in 1971 despaired of differentiating Stereum complicatum and Stereum gausapatum from Stereum hirsutum because they were little different microscopically and morphological features were not dependable. Welden's solution was to synonymize the other five taxa in the complex with Stereum hirsutum. |RANGE Stereum hirsutum is found in BC, WA, OR, ID, and also AB, NB, NF, NS, NT, ON, PE, PQ, SK, AK, AL, AR, AZ, CA, CO, CT, DC, FL, GA, IA, IN, LA, MA, MD, ME, MI, MN, MO, MS, MT, NC, NH, NJ, NM, NY, OH, OK, PA RI, SC, SD, TN, TX, VA, VT, WI, WV, and WY, (Ginns(5) who recognize the members of the complex as independent species).

NAME ORIGIN  means 'hairy'
SIMILAR  Stereum complicatum 1) is cespitose, strongly confluent, and often imbricate (whereas S. hirsutum is single or gregarious, with some confluence), 2) the folding of the cap is radiately complicate, whereas the cap of S. hirsutum is applanate or radially undulate, and 3) has scant or appressed tomentum, so that cap surface is bald or scantily tomentose, shining, and is concentrically zonate with thin, alternating bands of orange and brownish, whereas Stereum hirsutum has thick tomentum, forming a tomentose, hirsute, strigose, or hispid cap surface that is concentrically furrowed, (Chamuris(3)); Stereum versicolor (Swartz: Fr.) Fr. - found in Florida and other tropical / subtropical areas - has scant or appressed tomentum, so that cap surface is bald or scantily tomentose, shining, and is concentrically zonate with thin, alternating bands of orange and brownish, (Chamuris(3)); Stereum gausapatum can be distinguished from members of the Stereum hirsutum complex on the basis of 1) pseudocystidial wall thickness less than 1.5 microns (members of the Stereum hirsutum complex have pseudocystidial wall thickness greater than 1.5 microns), other characters that can be helpful are 2) Stereum gausapatum is restricted to Quercus (oak), (members of the Stereum hirsutum complex can grow on oak, but a Stereum specimen on oak is most likely to be S. gausapatum), 3) S. gausapatum usually bleeds or bruises red, while dry hymenia show dark violet or blackish stains instead, 4) caps of S. gausapatum are usually radially plicate, 5) the hymenium of S. gausapatum is buff to clay-colored, whereas that of S. hirsutum is yellow to pale orange, (Chamuris(4)); Stereum subtomentosum [regarded by Chamuris(4) as a synonym of S. hirsutum, but suspected by Ginns(5) to be a common species with specimens misnamed S. ostrea] is "similar but well distinguished by usually larger and more spathulate fruitbodies with a softer and more adpressed and velutinous tomentum" (in Scandinavia restricted to alder), (Eriksson); Stereum ostrea differs microscopically from the Stereum hirsutum group [having pseudoacanthohyphidia for instance] "but can usually be told by its slightly larger caps" (1-7cm broad) "that are more prominently zoned (dark reddish and brown) and usually form individual brackets rather than fusing, and buff to cinnamon-buff underside", (Arora); Hymenochaetopsis tabacina resembles the S. hirsutum group in shape and color, but its tissue blackens in KOH, (Arora).

NAME ORIGIN  from 'sanguis', Latin for 'blood' and '-lentus', Latin for 'full of, prone to'
SIMILAR  Stereum rugosum and Stereum ostrea also have pseudoacanthohyphidia [and turn red with bruising] but grow on hardwoods, (Chamuris(3)), Stereum rugosum is regularly perennial and has a series of hymenia that give radial sections a stratified appearance, (Chamuris(3)); Stereum complicatum may bruise red, but favors hardwoods, and microscopic examination of radial sections reveals that the conducting hyphae do not possess the brownish contents typical of S. gausapatum [and S. sanguinolentum], (Chamuris(4)); Stereum hirsutum does not generally bruise red although according to Jahn 1971 fruitbodies can be found that turn red when injured during their active phase of growth, (Breitenbach); Stereum hirsutum favors hardwoods as well, and neither Stereum complicatum nor Stereum complicatum have pseudoacanthohyphidia (Chamuris(3)); Stereum gausapatum bleeds when cut or touched, but is restricted to oak and lacks pseudoacanthohyphidia

NAME ORIGIN  
SIMILAR  Tulasnella violea (Quel.)
