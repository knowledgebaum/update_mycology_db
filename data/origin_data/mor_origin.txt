ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  Features include saddle-shaped to 2-lobed or irregularly lobed cap that is red-brown to dark red brown, most often with violet tints, with edge curved down on one horizontal axis and up on the horizontal axis at right angles, and both fused to itself (to form the saddle) and fused to stem, white to cream or light red-brown downy underside, pale pinkish cream to purple brown downy stem that often has violaceous tints, the stem round in cross-section or fluted at base, growth under conifers (especially pine) or on conifer wood, and somewhat spindle-shaped spores with two droplets and distinct or indistinct apiculi.^ Gyromitra species can be very poisonous when eaten raw, although toxicity varies with the individual, and certain individuals who have eaten Gyromitra mushrooms without effect have had severe reactions on another exposure. In a 1967 report of 513 cases of this kind of poisoning, 14% were fatal. Gyromitra ambigua is probably like Gyromitra esculenta in containing gyromitrin (and other hydrazones), which is metabolized to what appears to be the major toxin, monomethylhydrazine (that has been used as a rocket fuel). Much but not all of this becomes a vapor during cooking and can be poisonous as vapor. Poisoning starts between 2 and 24 hours and may start with vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain and headache. Sometimes there is fever. Liver toxicity occurs about 36-48 hours, and then neurological symptoms including seizures and coma. Sometimes there is intravascular hemolysis, kidney failure, or methemoglobinemia. With lower doses, there is still concern that these mushrooms are carcinogenic.

NAME ORIGIN  
SIMILAR  Disciotis venosa is more cup-like and more veined, sometimes has a chlorine odor, and has smooth spores without large oil droplets (but sometimes small droplets at ends outside the spore wall). Discina leucoxantha is yellowish, has somewhat different spores, and is found under both hardwoods and conifers, (Arora). D. leucoxantha has a bright yellow brown to orange brown fresh upper surface and the spore apiculi are depressed (concave-truncate, each appearing as if there are two points instead of one), (Abbott). Gyromitra melaleucoides has a somewhat waxy-looking underside when moist, a sometimes slightly longer narrower stem, and much shorter non-apiculate spores, (Arora). Gyromitra olympiana is smaller, with different spores (strongly three-sided, in one view narrow and in another almost diamond-shaped), whereas spores of G. ancilis are narrowly fusoid and have prominent apiculi, (Kanouse(6) discussing Discina olympiana and Discina perlata). Some spores of Gyromitra olympiana have a broad blunt thickening at both ends. Spores of Gyromitra ancilis, Gyromitra olympiana, Gyromitra leucoxantha, and Gyromitra melaleucoides should be mature spores from a spore deposit when comparison is made (Michael Beug, pers. comm.)

LATIN NAMES  Gyromitra columbiana  Harmaja^  Karstenia 26(2): 41. 1986
ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  The dark brown head of the fruitbody is indistinctly lobed and fairly densely folded, the stem is short, and microscopic characters include spores 13-18 x 7.5-8.5 microns with two equal droplets 4.5-6 microns across, secondary spore walls slightly inflated toward spore ends, and paraphyses predominantly clavate, some being subcapitate.^ The description is derived from Harmaja(4). Abbott(1) comments about this species (with Latin names in italics), "Harmaja (1986) described G. columbiana from British Columbia, and separated it from G. infula based on the densely folded hymenium and large clavate paraphyses, and from G. esculenta based primarily on smaller ascospores. He also notes that it was not possible to determine vernal versus autumnal fruiting pattern. Although we have not examined the type, the description seems consistent with G. infula. Several collections were examined with highly convoluted apothecia which were otherwise typical of G. infula, and our observations of paraphyses were not substantially different from those described for G. columbiana. Rahm (1970) describes G. infula forma gyrosa Benedix, which is highly convoluted and similar in habit to G. esculenta. Also, given our familiarity with the Shuswap region of British Columbia, we suggest that the collection made on July 30 represents an autumnal fruiting pattern, even given the elevation of 1500 metres."

NAME ORIGIN  
SIMILAR  Gyromitra infula does not feature the same folded hymenium, and has longer spores and different paraphysis tips, (Harmaja(4) who refers to Harmaja(6) where spores of G. infula are (17)20-23(26) x 7.0-10 microns and paraphyses are capitate to subclavate, +/- abruptly expanding to a roundish head as much as 13 microns wide and covered with a more or less thick layer of red-brown mass). Gyromitra esculenta has larger spores with smaller oil droplets, (Harmaja(4) who refers to the description of G. esculenta in Harmaja(5) where Type 1 (probably G. esculenta s. str.) has spores ca. 18-23(25) x 10.0-12.5 microns, Type II has spores ca. 20-25 x 10.0-12.5 microns, and Type III (?

NAME ORIGIN  
SIMILAR  Gyromitra fastigiata (Krombh.) Rehm is treated by Abbott(1) and by Weber(3) as a species known from eastern and southern North America, while the same species is called G. brunnea by McKnight who uses the name G. fastigiata for G. korfii. Weber(3) differentiates Gyromitra fastigiata from G. korfii and G. montana in the key as 'Stalk stark white when fresh; head with pronounced red to reddish brown tones in the hymenium; spores ornamented with a distinct reticulum that continues as several short projections at each end of the spore', and then from G. caroliniana as 'Head distinctly lobed, the adjacent (inner) sides of each lobe fused where in contact and edges raised as if to form "wings," surface not appearing pitted'.

ENGLISH NAMES  saddle-shaped false morel, hooded false morel
NOTES  Features include a saddle-shaped to 2-lobed or irregularly lobed cap that is yellow-brown to orange brown, with the edge curved down on one horizontal axis and up on the horizontal axis at right angles, and both fused to itself (to form the saddle) and fused to stem; white to pale brown downy underside; pallid pinkish cream to grayish purple brown downy stem that is round in cross-section or often fluted at base; growth under conifers (especially spruce) or on conifer wood; and narrowly elliptic spores with two droplets and no apiculi.^ Harmaja described Gyromitra columbiana in 1986 from BC, and separated it from G. infula "based on the densely folded hymenium and large clavate paraphyses" and from G. esculenta "based primarily on smaller ascospores", but the description seems consistent with G. infula, (Abbott). Gyromitra species can be very poisonous when eaten raw, although toxicity varies with the individual, and certain individuals who have eaten Gyromitra mushrooms without effect have had severe reactions on another exposure. In a 1967 report of 513 cases of this kind of poisoning, 14% were fatal. Gyromitra infula is probably like Gyromitra esculenta in containing gyromitrin (and other hydrazones), which is metabolized to what appear to be the major toxin, monomethylhydrazine (that has been used as a rocket fuel). Much but not all of this becomes a vapor during cooking and can be poisonous as vapor. Poisoning starts between 2 and 24 hours and may start with vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain and headache. Sometimes there is fever. Liver toxicity occurs at about 36-48 hours, and then neurological symptoms including seizures and coma. Sometimes there is intravascular hemolysis, kidney failure, or methemoglobinemia. With lower doses, there is still concern that these mushrooms are carcinogenic. (Benjamin from “Despite”). RANGE Collections examined from BC, WA, ID, AB, MB, NWT, SK, AK, CA, MT, NY, WY, Costa Rica, Slovakia, and Sweden, and G. infula has been reported also from OR, eastern North America, Europe, and Asia, (Abbott).

SIMILAR  Gyromitra ambigua tends to be darker red-brown with stronger violaceous tints, and has apiculate spores that are subfusoidal and 21-30 microns long, (Abbott). G. ambigua 1) has a more or less distinct violet tinge, especially when fresh, 2) the fruitbody is smaller on average, 3) the cap usually darker (even black when dry, brownish hoary when dry from discharged spores rather than whitish), 4) the hymenium is more often wrinkled (it is smooth when young and sometimes later too but with age it often becomes irregularly wrinkled), 5) the seam at the outer side of the lobes of the cap seems to be less prominent and tighter, 6) habitat favors pines (perhaps always associated at least in Europe) and poor sandy soil whereas G. infula occurs on less poor sites, especially near Picea and often in decaying wood, 7) distribution is more northern and favors higher altitudes, 8) fruiting season is on the average some weeks earlier where both occur, 9) most importantly, since "the macroscopic features alone very often do not permit a positive identification", the spores are different - the spores of G. ambigua "are longer (even without the perispore), broader, the true spore apex is narrower and the spores thus more clearly fusiform, and the perispore is more inflated at the spore apices", 10) the paraphyses enlarge more gradually to the apex, "which is somewhat narrower on the average". (Harmaja(6)). Gyromitra esculenta fruits in spring, has a large convoluted head that is medium to dark red brown or orange brown, and spore size and apiculation are different, (Abbott). Helvellas with non-fluted stems usually have more slender stems, and the color of the cap generally different, (Arora). See also SIMILAR section of Gyromitra columbiana.

SIMILAR  Gyromitra esculenta has a stem that is more or less round in cross-section, typically with one internal channel, or sometimes somewhat flattened with two internal channels, whereas the stem of Gyromitra montana has a more irregular stem with several internal anastomosing channels. Harmaja(10), in describing Gyromitra montana said that it differs from G. gigas by, the perispore excluded, slightly more elliptic, less fusiform spores with somewhat broader ends, "the inconstancy of the presence of the spore apiculi, the variable and often irregular shape and smaller size of the latter when discernible, the slightly more delicate ornamentation of the perispore, the thicker tips of the paraphyses" which may even be capitate and attain a breadth of about 13 microns (in Melzer's reagent) while in G. gigas they are clavate to subcapititate and only reach a diameter of about 10 microns, "the earlier fruiting time often near melting snow (sometimes even developing fruitbodies under the snow!), and the different distribution in the mountains of western North America and Austria in Europe" (fruiting time and the distribution according to McKnight 1971), (Harmaja(10)). Gyromitra montana is difficult to distinguish from Gyromitra korfii [of eastern North America] on field characters, but G. korfii has relatively narrow spores and prominent knob-like apiculi at each end (rather than broad spores and pad-like apiculi), (Weber), G. korfii can be distinguished by differences which are similar to those between G. montana and G. gigas as regards spore shape, features of the spore apiculi, and the characters of occurrence but also because of the longer and broader spores of G. montana, (Harmaja(10)).

NAME ORIGIN  after Olympic National Park, where the type collection was found^ (Kanouse)
SIMILAR  Gyromitra ancilis is larger and has different spores that are narrowly fusoid and with prominent apiculi, whereas those of G. olympiana strongly three-sided (in one view narrow and in another almost diamond-shaped), (Kanouse discussing Discina olympiana and Discina perlata). Some spores of Gyromitra ancilis have prominent pointed apiculi at both ends. Some spores of Gyromitra leucoxantha have concave apiculi at maturity. Spores of Gyromitra melaleucoides are smaller and lack apiculi. Spores of Gyromitra ancilis, Gyromitra olympiana, Gyromitra leucoxantha, and Gyromitra melaleucoides should be mature spores from a spore deposit when comparison is made (Michael Beug, pers. comm.).

SIMILAR  Helvella latispora is lighter in color (pale brown to light yellow brown when dried instead of medium to dark gray-brown to brown or blackish brown when dried), and spores average slightly shorter, (Abbott). Helvella compressa has the underside of the cap villose (as opposed to finely pubescent to pubescent for H. albella), (Abbott). Helvella elastica lacks the pubescent underside and the initially inrolled margin of H. albella, the margin of H. elastica may occasionally be attached to the stem, and the stem of H. elastica is hollow: older specimens of H. albella with near bald underside and reflexed margin may be difficult to distinguish from H. elastica, (Abbott).

NAME ORIGIN  means 'bearing ribs'
SIMILAR  Helvella acetabulum has been differentiated on the basis of color (H. costifera is grayer and the underside is not yellow brown), ribbing (H. costifera ribs are blunt and often more widely spaced, but rarely ribs on H. acetabulum are blunt), and fruiting time (H. costifera fruits later, but overlaps with later collections of H. acetabulum), (Abbott). Helvella solitaria is similar in color but has less prominent ribbing on stem and underside of cap, and a relatively narrower stem, (Abbott).

NAME ORIGIN  means "oak-loving"
SIMILAR  An undescribed Helvella, also fruiting in spring and squat in stature, is described as follows, "From a distance it looks like Helvella dryophila, but this species is associated with conifers, not oaks. Also the stipe is much fatter and very different - it is composed of 1 mm thick tissue folded and pleated (and lacking the strength to hold the cap up very well)." (Mike Beug, pers. comm.). Helvella dryophila is similar to H. vespertina but 1) the host is different (oak instead of conifer), 2) the contrast in colour between the cap and stem is striking, 3) the cap "is very dark and squat and rounded with distinct well defined grooves when young", and 4) the fruitbodies are only up to 8.5cm tall, (Nguyen). Michael Beug (pers. comm.) points out however that because with Helvella dryophila often there is little contrast between cap and stalk color and sometimes the cap is brownish or gray, not always black. The distinctive features are squat appearance and late winter-spring fruiting. Helvella vespertina tends to fruit in fall, and Helvella dryophila in spring.

NOTES  {See also Elfin Saddle Table.} This species under conifers in the Pacific Northwest has been known as Helvella lacunosa (a name that covers other species as well). Features include an irregularly lobed cap with the margins turned down and fused to the stem (rarely free), colored light to dark gray, the underside bald and pale when young to pale gray, the stem white becoming gray, highly ribbed and with holes in the surface, growth under conifers on the ground or rarely on wood, primarily in fall, and broadly elliptic spores with one droplet.^ The group of fungi that has been known under the name Helvella lacunosa comprises a number of species, including in the Pacific Northwest the common Helvella vespertina, Helvella dryophila (under oak, at least as far north as Oregon), and undescribed spp. The main description below is derived from Nguyen(1). The Abbott(1) and Arora(1) descriptions provide additional detail but some aspects of the descriptions could come from other hidden species. In particular the full range of colors for Helvella vespertina is not yet precisely known. Helvella vespertina is frequently disfigured by the whitish to pinkish parasite Hypomyces cervinigenus and is, less often, host to Clitocybe sclerotoidea. Helvella sulcata, synonymized by Abbott with Helvella lacunosa, is similar but has a small, pale gray to black cap that is usually saddle-shaped with a deep, well-defined cleft plus a ribbed but not lacunose stem, and often grows on rotten wood. RANGE Abbott(1) examined many collections [as H. lacunosa but presumed to represent H. vespertina in large part] from BC, WA, OR, ID, CA, (especially the first two) as well as elsewhere in Canada, USA, and Europe, (Abbott). Helvella vespertina is "widespread and common in the western parts of North America, at sea level in the coastal areas to around 1800 m in the Sierra Nevada and other mountain regions", is known from Vancouver Island (BC), CA, OR and ID and is probably more widespread (Nguyen).

SIMILAR  Helvella dryophila is similar to H. vespertina but 1) the host is different (oak instead of conifer), 2) the contrast in colour between the cap and stem is striking, 3) the cap "is very dark and squat and rounded with distinct well defined grooves when young", and 4) the fruitbodies are only up to 8.5cm tall, (Nguyen), H. dryophila tends to fruit in spring, and Helvella vespertina in fall. Helvella crispa may be somewhat similar to pale forms of H. 'lacunosa', but the underside of the cap is pubescent and the marginal curvature is different, (Weber). Helvella maculata is villose on the underside of the cap, and has an incurved cap that unrolls to flaring. (Mottling may occur in H. vespertina and may be absent in H. maculata, and colors of the upper surface could overlap in the two species.). An undescribed Helvella fruiting in spring and squat in stature is described as follows, "From a distance it looks like Helvella dryophila, but this species is associated with conifers, not oaks. Also the stipe is much fatter and very different - it is composed of 1 mm thick tissue folded and pleated (and lacking the strength to hold the cap up very well)." (Mike Beug, pers. comm.).

Kuo, Dewsbury, Moncalvo & S.L. Stephenson, but the former name has priority. Clowez(1) refers to the Kuo concept in describing Morchella americana. The Kuo et al. description for M. esculentoides is paraphrased here too for comparison (Kuo(6)), as well as an older one for Morchella 'esculenta' in North America derived from Weber(3). |These taxa have been known in North America under the European name Morchella esculenta (L.: Fr.) Pers., but molecular research indicates that different taxa are involved. |Morchella americana is said to be common in many areas in the east of the US and Canada. Morchella esculentoides is said to be widely distributed and common east of the Rocky Mountains (including the Great Lakes region): in western North America it is found in river bottoms or in urban areas, (Kuo(6)). |M. Beug (pers. comm.) says in the Pacific Northwest Morchella americana is typically found under black cottonwoods in river bottoms. |Clowez(1) also described Morchella californica Clowez & D. Viess associated with Fraxinus dipetala in California, but this has been synonymized by Richard(1). |A morel that fits the classical concept of M. esculenta occurs in eastern Oregon (different from PS E mentioned under Morchella species), (Pilz(1)). |The name 'Morchella crassipes' has been used to refer to a yellow morel found late in the season with a swollen stem, but these have often proven to be a growth form of the yellow morel, (Kuo(1)). |RANGE Collections of M. americana (as M. esculentoides) were examined from OR, ON, AR, CA, CO, IA, IL, KS, MA, MN, MO, NE, NY, OH, OK, PA, SC, SD, TX, VT, VA, WI, WV, (Kuo(6)). It also occurs in central Europe (Richard(1)). There are six collections as Morchella esculenta from BC at Pacific Forestry Centre in Victoria, and 4 collections from BC at the University of British Columbia (as well as one as M. deliciosa under Populus in sand), some of which are likely to represent this species.

NAME ORIGIN  means 'edible'
SIMILAR  Morchella tridentina, the mountain blond morel (PS E), also occurs away from fires and has the ribs separating the pits lighter in color (ivory to nearly white) than the lining of the pits when old. By maturity the ribs are off-white sometimes with amber stains and bruises. Pits are gray when very young, becoming tan, golden, or straw yellow when mature. It differs from most descriptions of M. esculenta from Europe or elsewhere in North America in that 1) it has a relatively narrow head, rather than oval or rounded, especially in young specimens, 2) "the primary ribs are strongly vertical and relatively straight producing elongated pits rather than the rounded to somewhat irregular pits generally attributed to M. esculenta [Latin name in italics]", and 3) it "seems to be characteristic of conifer forests including either lodgepole or ponderosa pine, whereas the complex centered on M. esculenta [Latin name in italics] is commonly associated with hardwoods sometimes mixed with conifers." (Pilz). Kuo (2006) calls M. tridentina (as M. frustrata) the western blond morel "to reflect the fact that the Western Blond is found not only under conifers at high elevations but also under hardwoods at lower elevations". The colors, he says, suggest a yellow morel, since the ridges do not darken with age and the overall color of the cap is fairly pale throughout development--though the mature cap colors are just a little bit browner than the colors of the typical yellow morel. The stature of the Western Blond, however, 'suggests a black morel; the pits and ridges are more vertically arranged than those of the esculenta-like yellow morels, and the cap attaches to the stem with a shallow "rim"--a feature not usually found with yellow morels.' (Kuo(2)). Morchella prava (known from BC, OR, ON, SK, MT, and SD and reported from WA) is distinguished by dark pits and a very contorted head, (M. Beug, pers. comm.). M. prava "usually can be identified on the basis of its esculenta-like stature and its contorted, asymmetrical and irregular pits and ridges. The pits are highly irregular in outline and size, and the thick, bluntly rounded ridges are less likely to become eroded and sharpened with maturity than the ridges in M. esculentoides"; the cap "often appears like a contorted or somewhat deformed version" of the M. esculentoides cap. Significant microscopic differences from M. esculentoides were not observed although the elements on sterile ridges in specimens studied generally were sparsely scattered or nearly absent, whereas they were easily located in M. esculentoides. (Kuo(6) with the Latin italicized). M. prava is one of three species that has been known in the past by the name Morchella deliciosa, commonly found in field guides. Morchella deliciosa refers to a European morel described by Fries. It was described for North America by Weber in 1995 and documented for eastern North America. Kuo(6) do not recognize M. deliciosa of Europe for North America and describe three eastern North American species that have been considered as M. deliciosa in the past, one of them being M. prava. According to Kuo (1), the mushrooms are small in comparison to the classic North American yellow morels [i.e. to what are later called M. esculentoides], and the pits and ridges are sparser proportionally and more vertically arranged. Additionally the caps are frequently but not always more pointed. (Kuo(1)). What has passed for Morchella deliciosa in California is thought to be Morchella rufobrunnea (the blushing morel), described from Mexico in 1998. The trademark physical features of Morchella rufobrunnea, according to Kuo(2) are the frequently pointed cap (especially when young), the striking contrast of the light-colored, vertically arranged ridges and darker pits in young mushrooms, and the fact that it is rufescent, meaning that it blushes pinkish to salmon orange when bruised, especially when young. To complicate things further, says Kuo, 'some authors (including Lincoff, 1992; Bessette, Bessette & Fischer, 1997; and Roody, 2003) describe a large, white morel with dark pits as "Morchella deliciosa" in an erroneous interpretation of Fries's original description'. Kuo maintains that the mushrooms described by these authors are probably merely immature forms or ecotypes of the yellow morel. (Kuo(2)).

NOTES  {See also Morels Table.} According to Kuo M. exuberans (as Morchella capitata) is distinct microscopically among burn site black morels, based on specimens examined: "elements on its sterile ridges are overwhelmingly capitate, often dramatically so". According to Richard(1), this post-fire morel is distinctive because it frequently is greenish, but other experts caution against the use of pink or green color in distinguishing species. Other features include conic to somewhat conic cap with pits and ridges, the ridges bald or finely tomentose, olive, brown, or blackish becoming dark brown to black, the pits olive to brownish or tan, stem occasionally subclavate, whitish darkening to brownish, often mealy, fruiting in conifer forest the year after a fire, and other microscopic characters.^ The description is derived from Kuo(6). Because several of the collections studied had greenish pits, Kuo(6) considered it likely that M. capitata has been included in the concept of the green morel set forth in Pilz(2) [i.e. PS C], although several M. sextelata and M. septimelata specimens also had green pits. RANGE Specimens examined were collected in CA (type) and Sweden (Richard(1)), and OR (Kuo(6)). It has also been documented by molecular means from MI and TN (Miller, A.N.(1)).

NAME ORIGIN  refers to the capitate elements on the sterile ridges^ (Kuo)
SIMILAR  According to Beug(3), two other species are presently indistinguishable by macroscopic appearance and ecology but microscopically lack the ridge elements with a terminal cell that is usually capitate. These species are 1) Morchella sextelata M. Kuo (collections examined from WA, ID, MT, WY, YT), 2) Morchella eximia Boudier with synonym M. septimelata M. Kuo (collections examined as M. septimelata from BC, OR, MT, and as Morchella anthracophila from BC). (Beug(3)). The elements on the sterile edges of M. septimelata are primarily subclavate to clavate in the specimens examined. The elements on the sterile edges of M. sextelata are cylindrical with a rounded apex, subfusoid, subcapitate or block-like. This is enough to separate M. capitata from M. eximia as M. septimelata and from M. sextelata, but not to separate the latter two species from each other: "this distinction is too tentative and based on too few specimens examined for us to express confidence that the difference is consistent [between M. septimelata and M. sextelata]". M. sextelata sometimes had pink pits and was probably included in the concept of the pink morel of Pilz(2) [i.e. PS B] but some M. septimelata specimens had pink pits also, and some of the latter had green pits like some M. capitata.

NOTES  These photographs show a range of variation in Morchella species of the Mel clade (named after Morchella elata) which could also be called the black morel clade. There is also an Mes clade (named after Morchella esculenta) which could be called the yellow morel clade. O'Donnell(1) presented a molecular study that distinguished 24 members of the Mel clade named Mel-1, Mel-2, etc., from 16 members of the Mes named Mes-1, Mes-2, etc. Morchella rufobrunnea is separate from those two clades. The Mel clade includes M. tomentosa (Mel-1), M. tridentina (Mel-2), M. populiphila (Mel-5), M. sextelata (Mel-6), M. eximia (Mel-7), M. exuberans (Mel-9), M. importuna (Mel-10), M. snyderi (Mel-12), M. eohespera (Mel-19), and M. brunnea (Mel-22).

NOTES  {See also Morels Table.} Morchella prava is the correct name for what was described as Morchella esculentoides. "The species usually can be identified on the basis of its esculenta-like stature and its contorted, asymmetrical and irregular pits and ridges. The pits are highly irregular in outline and size, and the thick, bluntly rounded ridges are less likely to become eroded and sharpened with maturity than the ridges in M. esculentoides"; the cap "often appears like a contorted or somewhat deformed version" of the M. esculentoides cap. Significant microscopic differences from M. esculentoides were not observed although the elements on sterile ridges in specimens studied generally were sparsely scattered or nearly absent, whereas they were easily located in M. esculentoides.

NAME ORIGIN  honors Leon Carlton Snyder (1908-1987), who named M. hotsonii and M. crassistipa from WA in the 1930s
SIMILAR  Morchella brunnea M. Kuo, another 'natural black', 1) has a more brown cap when young whereas M. snyderi tends to be pale when young, 2) has a stem that is not regularly lacunose, (Kuo(2)), 3) has a more distinct sinus between cap and stem, 4) has a more slender stem with flesh that is thinner and crushes more easily, 5) is less common and prefers hardwood habitat, and 6) grows scattered not clustered, (Michael Beug, pers. comm.). Morchella frustrata lacks a conspicuously lacunose stem, its pits are bald, and spores average smaller, (Kuo(6)). See also SIMILAR section of Morchella tridentina.

LATIN NAMES  Morchella tomentosa  M. Kuo^  Mycotaxon 105: 441. 2008
ENGLISH NAMES  black-foot morel, fuzzy-foot morel, black-stocking morel, gray morel
NOTES  {See also Morels Table.} Morchella tomentosa is distinguished from other morels by the densely tomentose and often black surfaces when young. Features are densely tomentose young ridges that are black to gray or brownish, the ridges eroded or flattened when old, bald pits that vertically elongate by maturity, young stem that is densely tomentose and gray to black, and fruiting at 1000-3400 meters altitude in years following forest fires. Older specimens "may have eroded ridges and paler colors that approximate the colors of M. esculenta-like yellow morels" [Latin name italicized] but these still demonstrate pigmented hairs on ridges and stem surface and can thus be distinguished microscopically (Kuo).^ The description is derived from Kuo(3) except where noted. RANGE Morchella tomentosa has been found in OR, ID, YT, AK, CO, and MT, (Kuo(3)). Collections of "Morchella atrotomentosa nom. prov." from BC at the Pacific Forestry Centre are likely to represent this species.

NOTES  {See also Morels Table.} Features include conic cap with ridges and vertically oriented pits, attached to stipe with small trough at lower margin, pale colors (but the ridges darken when old), stem that is not conspicuously lacunose, and growth under hardwoods in the lowlands but under conifers at medium to high elevations.^ Kuo called this the "western blond", and he in turn linked it to the Pilz(2) description of the "mountain blond" (PS-E), but changed the English name to reflect that it also occurs in the lowlands. Later Kuo(2) described Morchella frustrata, saying that it 'is likely the same as the morel informally designated the "mountain blond morel"' in Pilz(2). Descriptions of these two concepts are used below. Richard(1) has synonymized Morchella frustrata with Morchella tridentina.
