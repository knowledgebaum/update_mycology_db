SIMILAR  Clavariadelphus ligula: Petersen says "Macrochemically as gross morphologically, it is impossible to separate C. ligulus and C. sachalinensis, but the two are easily distinguished microscopically", (Petersen). Methven agrees, "Although basidiocarps of C. sachalinensis are impossible to distinguish from those of C. ligula in the field, they can be readily distinguished microscopically by the size of the basidia and the basidiospores", (Methven). C. ligula is distinguished by spore size, 12-16.5 x 3.5-4.5 microns instead of 18-24 x 4-6 microns, (Trudell). Clavariadelphus mucronatus has different height, shape and color, and size of spores, (Methven).

Features of Clavariadelphus truncatus include a club-shaped fruiting body that is pinkish cinnamon to lavender-brown when mature with apex yellow-orange, orange or reddish, the blunt apex becoming truncate, excavated, or perforated (umbonate in var. umbonatus), cherry red to fire-engine red reaction of surface to KOH, dark green tissue reaction to FeCl3, and microscopic characters.^ C. truncatus has been regarded by some authors as a mature form of C. pistillaris (of eastern North America, Europe, and Asia) in which the top of the fruitbody has become truncate, but the two differ in the following: 1) C. pistillaris is pale ochraceous to brownish, while C. truncatus has the colors given above, 2) C. pistillaris tastes bitter whereas C. truncatus tastes sweet, 3) the apex of C. pistillaris is spore-bearing, but the apex of C. truncatus is sterile, 4) C. pistillaris is not stained on the surface by KOH and C. truncatus stains cherry red to fire-engine red on the surface, 5) C. pistillaris has spores 10.5-14 x 6-7.5 microns, whereas C. truncatus has smaller spores 9.5-13 x 5.5-7 microns, 6) C. pistillaris occurs in hardwood forests in association with beech, while C. truncatus occurs in coniferous forest. In the umbonate variety, C. truncatus var. umbonatus (Peck), the apex instead of being "initially broadly obtuse, becoming truncate, excavate or perforate at maturity" as in var. truncatus, is "clavate-umbonate to truncate-umbonate at maturity, not becoming excavate or perforate". In another variety, C. truncatus var. lovejoy (Wells & Kempton) Corner, the apex of the fruitbody is bright red, and spores measure 9.5-12.5 x 4.5-6.5 microns. RANGE The distribution of C. truncatus var. truncatus includes BC, WA, OR, ID, AB, NS, ON, PQ, YT, AK, AZ, CA, CO, KY, MA, ME, MD, MI, MN, MT, NM, NY, OH, PA, TN, UT, VA, WI, Mexico, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, China, and India, (Methven). C. truncatus var. umbonatus (Peck) Methven occurs at least in ID, OR, NY, and Mexico. C. truncatus var. lovejoy occurs at least in CO and WY.

LATIN NAMES  Claviceps purpurea  (Fr.) Tul.^  in Sacc. Syll. fung. (Abellini) 2: 564. 1883
ENGLISH NAMES  ergot, spurred rye
NOTES  Also listed in Other category. Claviceps purpurea is usually seen as a dark-colored, hard, elongate, somewhat bent sclerotium in the panicle of grasses. It also forms (the next year) a fruiting body divided into an ocher to orange-yellow head and a sinuous reddish brown stem growing on the old sclerotium.^ Claviceps purpurea infects rye: if the sclerotia (which contain ergot alkaloids) are eaten by cattle, or if ergot-containing rye bread is eaten by humans, a form of poisoning results called ergotism or St. Anthony's fire (hallucinations, burning feelings, gangrene). Claviceps purpurea infects rye through the stigma when the rye is in flower. The mycelium produces masses of asexual spores (conidia) in a sweet smelling nectar, which causes it to be spread by insects to other plants. Then the mycelial mat hardens and forms a purplish sclerotium that falls to the ground and germinates the following spring. Each sclerotium produces several stromata that consist of a stem and a spherical head within which the perithecia develop with their ascospores. Claviceps was the original source of LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide), the potent psychedelic drug. RANGE Claviceps purpurea is widespread. There are collections specifically from BC, AB, IA, and Germany at the University of British Columbia, and from WA, AK, and New Zealand at the University of Washington.

ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  Features include 1) a very slender club-shaped pinkish orange to apricot fruitbody with the stem part somewhat distinct and having clearer colors, 2) single to somewhat tufted but not bundled habit, 3) growth on coniferous or deciduous leaf litter, and 4) microscopic characters.^ There is disagreement about the correct name for this material: Petersen synonymizes Clavulinopsis luteo-alba with Clavulinopsis gracillima, but Corner(3) disagrees with this opinion and continued to use the name C. luteo-alba for collection sites that include Washington. Corner gives Clavulinopsis gracillima Peck as a possible synonym of Clavulinopsis flavella (B. & C.) Corner, which (questionably according to Corner), Petersen synonymizes with Multiclavula clava. The description here is derived from Petersen(4) who says "I examined the holotype specimen of Clavaria gracillima and found it to be excellent representative material of what had formerly been known as C. luteo-alba.". Moreover, the current name for both Clavaria gracillima Peck and Clavulinopsis gracillima (Peck) R.H. Peterson is Clavaria flava Pers. in the Index Fungorum, accessed March 18, 2018.

NAME ORIGIN  
SIMILAR  Clavulinopsis fusiformis is not firmly established as a Pacific Northwest species. The following are differentiating features according to various authors. According to Arora it is taller (0.5-15cm) and bright yellow with round spores, (Arora). C. fusiformis is rarely collected in the Pacific Northwest: it has round, nearly round, or very broadly ovate spores, bright yellow color, and typically bundled habit, (Petersen). 1) C. fusiformis is yellow while C. laeticolor is usually some shade of orange, 2) both species can fruit in tufts, but clusters of C. fusiformis are more likely to be fused at the base, 3) C. laeticolor is usually mild in taste while C. fusiformis is typically bitter, 4) the two species react differently in KOH: according to Tylutki, a 10% KOH solution will turns the flesh of C. laeticolor yellowish-green to green, but has no effect on C. fusiformis [Tylutki actually says orange in KOH], and 5) spore shape differs, the spores of C. fusiformis spores being spherical, while those of C. laeticolor are nearly round to pyriform [pear-shaped], (MykoWeb). Calocera species are viscid and grow on wood, (Arora). Note that Clavulinopsis corniculata can occasionally be unbranched, and this might be suggested if fruitbodies are not clustered (Danny Miller, pers. comm.). Clavulinopsis helvola (Pers. ex Fr.) R.H. Petersen, which may occur in the Pacific Northwest (collection at Oregon State University), has bright yellow to orange yellow fruitbodies and angular-warty spores. Neolecta vitellina averages broader and has spores borne on asci rather than basidia, (Arora).

ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  Features include a black fertile part, a brownish black densely fine-scaly stem, growth on rotten wood, and microscopic characters.^ There is disagreement about how to delimit this species: Mains agrees with Nannfeldt in separating out G. simile, of eastern North America, commenting that "Most of the collections from North America which have been determined as G. glabrum are G. simile." G. simile is separated by its paraphyses that are "closely and abundantly septate above, with the upper cells not or slightly enlarged, constricted at septa to form many oblong, ellipsoid or obovoid 2-celled segments." Nannfeldt also separates out G. cookeianum Nannf. (G. difforme sensu Cooke), which is included by Mains in the type variety. Seaver includes both. Descriptions derived from Mains and Seaver are given below. Mains describes 1) var. glabrum from MI with ascospores mostly 7-septate, rarely less, and paraphyses having upper cells variously enlarged, globoid, ellipsoid and obovoid, moderately compressed at septa, 2) var. heterosporum from MD which differs in having variable septation, 3) var. americanum from WA and MI which differs from the type variety in having a few of the upper cells of the paraphyses decidedly globose and strongly constricted at the septa, 4) var. inflatum from MI, NY, VA, "Usually only the terminal cells of the paraphyses of this variety are enlarged. They are obovoid or pyriform, rarely ellipsoid or globoid. Below the terminal cells the upper cells of the paraphyses are mostly short cylindric. There is little or no constriction at the septa...Whether this variety belongs here or in G. nigritum is questionable but is included in G. glabrum on account of the straight, closely septate paraphyses.", and 5) var. elongatum from WA, CA, in which the paraphyses are considerably elongate and successions of cylindric cells are interspersed with inflated cells giving a proliferated appearance. Alan Silverside of the University of Paisley comments that the name G. glabrum has covered all kinds of things and is best abandoned, and that Seaver's concept is basically G. cookeianum, though Seaver included two other species (G. sphagnophilum and G. simile) in synonymy. RANGE Taking the various concepts together, G. glabrum has been found in WA, CA, MD, MI, NH, TN, (according to Mains). Seaver gives a distribution from NF to FL and CA, and Europe. There is a R.

The description is from Samuels(1) unless otherwise specified. RANGE Distribution is complicated by the fact that Hypocrea leucopus, which grows on the ground, was previously regarded as a synonym of this species. Of six collections of Podostroma alutaceum (a synonym of Hypocrea alutacea) from BC at the University of British Columbia, one was on wood, two were on the ground or duff, and the rest were unspecified.

SIMILAR  Hypocrea leucopus (as Podostroma leucopus) was previously considered to be a synonym of Hypocrea alutacea. Hypocrea leucopus typically occurs on the ground and Hypocrea alutacea on wood. Hypocrea leucopus has a Verticillium-like anamorph and Hypocrea alutacea a Trichoderma-like one, but these are generally not found in nature. Hypocrea alutacea is somewhat browner (golden yellow to a shade of brown versus pale yellow to golden brown). Hypocrea truncata (Podostroma truncatum) has a more truncate fruitbody with depressed apex (Castellano). Podostroma zeylandicum lacks a stem and has slightly warted spores (Castellano).

NOTES  Features include 1) a fruitbody that is cylindric to club-shaped without a well-defined cap, the lower part white to beige and the upper part pale yellow to golden brown, 2) minute dotting on the upper part, 3) growth on the ground in forest, and 4) microscopic characters including dimorphic part-spores^. The description is from Samuels(1) unless otherwise specified. RANGE This species has been photographed in WA. It is likely that many of the records of Podostroma alutaceum or Hypocrea alutacea in the Pacific Northwest are this species, as they are similar apart from habitat, and Podostroma leucopus used to be regarded as a synonym of Podostroma alutaceum.

ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  This stinkhorn begins as an underground "egg", the outer layer of which splits around the equator as the stem lengthens quickly. When mature, the color ranges from pink to white, the cap covered initially with a fetid olive green spore mass. The cap is in the form of a hollow cylinder attached in its upper part to the flaring wall of the hollow stem, the outside of the cap covered with a network that bears the spores mass. Eventually the cap curves upward and falls to the ground, exposing the wide opening at the top of the stem with its prominent collar. The distinctive characters of the genus are "the pseudoparenchymatous veins traversing the gleba [spore mass] and the pseudoparenchymatous cap at the apex of the stipe". The odor of the spore mass is like that of a flowering Acacia leucophloea [doubtless known better to the Indian author than to the average inhabitant of the Pacific Northwest], (Ahmad).^ Itajahya rosea is rare. RANGE A collection by L. Norvell and S. Redhead from WA is at the University of Washington. It is also found elsewhere in North America, W. Africa (Ghana), Israel, India, and Pakistan, (Dring).
CHEMICAL REACTIONS  
FRUITING BODY  cap in the form of a hollow cylindrical hood attached by its upper edge a short distance below the recurved margin of the funnel, and initially covering over the opening, covered on the outside with an intricate network of gill-like plates and tubercular processes between which the spore mass is born; spore mass olivaceous, mucilaginous, foetid; stem pink, spongy, hollow, cylindric or widening downward, top flat with recurved edge, at first covered by the pink hood which sloughs off to reveal the funnel-shaped entrance to the hollow center of the stem; develops from "egg" which is spherical to obovoid, white to pale brown, strongly rooting, usually by a single strand^, (Dring), the head is spherical: before the deliquescence of the spore mass the outer ends of pseudoparenchymatous veins filling the chambers in the spore mass appear strikingly conspicuous against the dark olive green background, the cap is continuous for some distance with the stem, becoming free lower down (but the lower free margin is covered by the spore mass); after the elongation of the stem the cap curves upward and falls to the ground, exposing the wide opening at the top of the stem; stem length 6.5-17cm, and the width below the cap is 2.5-4.5cm; the stem broadens toward the top where it is bent outward to form a very prominent collar, the wall of the stem is 5-6 chambered, and the cavity inside the stem widens toward the top; stem may be pink ("orange pink" or "orange buff" of Ridgway) or white, the latter previously known as Itajahya galericulata; eggs measure 2.5-8cm in diameter, and are white on emerging from the soil, becoming dirty white on contact with the air, turning brownish when handled roughly or when bruised, the eggs developing on thick profusely branched mycelial strands that are occasionally seen penetrating buried wood and the dead roots of grasses, a large number of eggs developing from a common mycelial strand; the outer layer (volva) ruptures around the equator and the stem elongates within 5-6 hours to its full length, (Ahmad)

ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  Features include a club-shaped, dark brown, purplish brown or black fruiting body with a widened compressed head, smooth or minutely squamulose stem, and microscopic characters including colorless spores.^ Mains includes here three species of Durand that are treated as separate species of Corynetes by Seaver: Durand separates Corynetes purpurascens from C. atropurpureus on the basis of having a more distinctly purplish tint when fresh and more abruptly thickened tips to the paraphyses, and Durand separates C. robustus from C. atropurpureus on the basis of its lack of an epithecium and paraphyses that are slightly thickened and curved at the tips. With regard to another close species Seaver gives the paraphyses of Corynetes arenarius as conspicuously brown, as opposed to colorless or only slightly purple-tinted at tips for the other three. According to Alan Silverside at the University of Paisley, they have in Britain the same 4 species as given by Seaver under Corynetes, but the names will need to be different. It is not clear which of the members of the Microglossum atropurpureum complex are found in the Pacific Northwest. Breitenbach gives Corynetes atropurpureus (Batsch ex Fr.)

SIMILAR  Mitrula borealis has been recorded much less often, and is reliably differentiated by its spores. It has been found in Montana close to the Idaho border, but not otherwise confirmed from the Pacific Northwest. Mitrula lunulatospora of eastern North America is distinguished by spores 11-19 x (2)2.5-3.5(4) microns that are lunate to cymbiform [boat-shaped] and inflexible. Mitrula paludosa of Europe has spores are slightly broader (11-19(24) x (2)2.5-3.5(4) microns) than spores of Mitrula elegans. Vibrissea truncorum is somewhat similar but prefers to fruit in running water and is usually submerged - the head is usually orangish to pinkish orange and rounder and more regularly shaped than with Mitrula elegans.

NOTES  Also listed in Toothed category. Fruitbodies are single or densely grouped soft wax-like white hanging spines up to 0.6cm long, growing on conifer wood or old polypores^. Corner(3) considered Mucronella alba Lloyd a synonym of Mucronella bresadolae, but note the difference in spore size from the European description of Breitenbach(2). The online Species Fungorum, accessed February 17, 2012, listed Mucronella alba Lloyd as a synonym of Mucronella pendula, as does Petersen(28). Mucronella alba could be regarded as an ambiguous name, but Siegel(2) use this name Mucronella alba for what has been called Mucronella bresadolae in the Pacific Northwest. RANGE Mucronella 'bresadolae' is found at least in BC, Austria, France, and Morocco, (Corner(3)), and Switzerland (Breitenbach). Corner's listing for BC appears to refer to R. Bandoni 116 (1958) at the University of British Columbia where it is still labeled Mucronella alba, but there are two other later UBC collections from BC labeled M. bresadolae, one of them by R. Bandoni 12743A (2000). Desjardin(6) illustrates it for CA.

NAME ORIGIN  
SIMILAR  Multiclavula mucida grows on wood. Multiclavula vernalis is difficult to distinguish: the microscopic structure is almost identical, although the spores can reach 12 microns long in M. vernalis. The fruitbodies of M. corynoides "are rather hard and brittle when dry, usually somewhat translucent toward the base, at least when fresh", while those of M. vernalis "are stouter, fleshier, opaque throughout, and usually larger", (Brodo(1) who say that Multiclavula vernalis is known only from the East [of North America]). M. vernalis is differentiated in the key by the sterigmata numbering strictly four or rarely less, whereas M. corynoides commonly has more than 4 sterigmata. (Petersen(27)). The key sections in Petersen(27) are also differentiated by color but distinction between cream to fleshy cream or straw-orange drying dull ochraceous orange for M. vernalis, as opposed to pale yellowish to straw or pinkish shades for M. corynoides would not seem easy to make. McCune(2) separate them as follows: Multiclavula corynoides has spores 5.6-8.5 x 2.1-3.5 microns, 4-6 sterigmata, fruitbodies "simple or with a hint of branching", 1-2.5cm high, "pale yellowish to straw or with pinkish shades, almost translucent, at least near the base, the tip often whitish when dry", whereas Multiclavula vernalis has spores 8-12 x 2.5-3.5 microns, 4 sterigmata, fruitbodies simple, to 2(2.7)cm high, "cream to fleshy cream or straw orange when fresh, dull ochraceous orange when dry, the tip often with a small white spot". They also comment "Petersen [1967] separated M. corynoides from M. vernalis partly on the basis of the number of sterigmata. I find this a difficult character; at least partly because the sterigmata are often very small and easily collapsed. He also separated these by basidiocarp color, but the colors appear to overlap". (McCune(2), with Latin italicized.) Multiclavula corynoides (Peck) R.H. Petersen was thought by Corner to be only the better developed state of Multiclavula vernalis (Corner(3), discussing both as Clavulinopsis taxa). A further controversy involves Clavaria mucida var. rosea Bres. Corner(2) mentions a report from Oregon by Doty with spores 7-7.5 x 2-3 microns, commenting that Doty is the only recent author to report it growing on the ground, and that var. rosea is possibly a form of Clavulinopsis vernalis. Petersen(27) on the other hand reduces Clavaria mucida var. rosea Sacc. to a synonym of Multiclavula corynoides.

SIMILAR  Multiclavula coronilla can also grow on wood. Petersen(27) differentiates them as follows: M. mucida has white to grayish or tannish fruitbodies, spores 4.5-7.7 x 1.8-3.2 microns, and basidia 4-6-sterignate, whereas M. coronilla has white to pale yellow fruitbodies, spores 5-7.5 x 2.1-3.8 microns, and basidia 6-8-sterigmate (Petersen(27)). McCune(2) use the same features including the colors but add for Multiclavula mucida that fruitbodies are up to 2cm high, usually simple [Petersen says "simple, lobed, or primordially branched"], and "highly variable in color, size, and shape, but typically white to cream, darkening to gray, pale tan, or dirty gray, but the tip often turning pure white on drying". For M. coronilla they add that fruitbodies are up to 1cm high, simple or once branched [Petersen says "simple"], and "white, light straw, or pale watery ochraceous, darkening when dry". (McCune(2)).

SIMILAR  Multiclavula mucida grows on wood. Multiclavula corynoides (Peck) R.H. Petersen was thought by Corner(3) to be only the better developed state of Multiclavula vernalis, but they are kept separate by Petersen(27) and Brodo(1). Corner(3) places a collection under C. vernalis from Washington with spores 7-9 x 2.5-2.7 microns (fitting with C. corynoides), but with a small, simple fruitbody and 4-spored basidia (as in C. vernalis). Brodo(1) says that M. vernalis is known only from the East (of North America). The two species are differentiated by Brodo(1) saying that the fruitbodies of M. corynoides "are rather hard and brittle when dry, usually somewhat translucent toward the base, at least when fresh", while those of M. vernalis "are stouter, fleshier, opaque throughout, and usually larger". Petersen(27) uses different features: M. vernalis is differentiated in the key by the sterigmata being strictly four or rarely less, whereas M. corynoides commonly has more than 4 sterigmata. (Petersen(27)). The key sections in Petersen(27) are also differentiated by color but distinction between cream to fleshy cream or straw-orange drying dull ochraceous orange for M. vernalis, and pale yellowish to straw or pinkish shades for M. corynoides would not seem easy to make. McCune(2) separate them as follows: Multiclavula corynoides has spores 5.6-8.5 x 2.1-3.5 microns, 4-6 sterigmata, fruitbodies "simple or with a hint of branching", 1-2.5cm high, "pale yellowish to straw or with pinkish shades, almost translucent, at least near the base, the tip often whitish when dry", whereas Multiclavula vernalis has spores 8-12 x 2.5-3.5 microns, 4 sterigmata, fruitbodies simple, to 2(2.7)cm high, "cream to fleshy cream or straw orange when fresh, dull ochraceous orange when dry, the tip often with a small white spot". They also comment "Petersen [1967] separated M. corynoides from M. vernalis partly on the basis of the number of sterigmata. I find this a difficult character; at least partly because the sterigmata are often very small and easily collapsed. He also separated these by basidiocarp color, but the colors appear to overlap". (McCune(2), with Latin italicized.) A further controversy involves Clavaria mucida var. rosea Bres. Corner(2) mentions a report from Oregon by Doty with spores 7-7.5 x 2-3 microns, commenting that Doty is the only recent author to report it growing on the ground, and that var. rosea is possibly a form of Clavulinopsis vernalis. Petersen(27) on the other hand reduces Clavaria mucida var. rosea Sacc. to a synonym of Multiclavula corynoides.

NOTES  Phallus impudicus develops from an egg-shape into a roughly cylindric fruiting body up to 25cm tall. The stem is up to 3cm wide, and the head up to 4cm wide, covered with dark olive foul-smelling slime. There is a sack-like volva at the stem base. Var. imperialis differs from the type variety only in having a pinkish rather than white volva (see also SIMILAR).^ RANGE Var. imperialis is found in CO, CA, TX, and DC, (Lloyd). Phallus impudicus is found in CA, NM, and UT, (Arora). It is rare in the Pacific Northwest but found in BC (in Redhead(5)), WA (R. Sieger, pers. comm., L. Foreman, pers. comm.), ID (H. Barnhart, pers. comm.), and MT (L. Evans, pers. comm.).
CHEMICAL REACTIONS  
FRUITING BODY  begins egg-shaped up to 6cm high, with outer covering white to yellowish white in one variety, lurid pinkish to purple in another, with gelatinous layer beneath, rupturing to form a volva as the stem elongates and thrusts the slimy swollen head upward; head 1.5-4cm across, coated with copious olive-green to olive-brown slime or mucilage which is foul-smelling when fruitbody is mature and which eventually drips off or is carried away by flies or washed away, revealing whitish pitted and ridged (reticulate) surface underneath, a hole at the top sometimes covered with fragment of the outer covering^, (Arora), egg 4-6 x 3-5cm, spherical or elongated, with mycelial thread at base; fruitbody up to 20cm x 3cm, (Lincoff(1)), egg develops just underground or under leaves; the outer covering breaks and the stem stretches up, a process that takes one and a half hours; the slimy mass produced by the mature fruitbody is quickly eaten by flies and slugs, (Schalkwijk-Barendsen), fruitbody up to 25cm tall, fertile part 1.5-4cm broad, (Smith)

SIMILAR  Phallus ravenelii, quite common in eastern North America, has a smooth to granular rather than reticulate head, (Arora). P. ravenelii has a smoother cap and a veil, usually short and hidden under the cap, (Lloyd). Phallus hadriani Vent., with Phallus imperialis Schulzer as a synonym, differs from P. impudicus in having a purple volva as opposed to a white one, and in having higher ridges: if this view is taken, Phallus hadriani would be the name for the usual Pacific Northwest taxon, but P. hadriani is often considered a variant of P. impudicus.

ENGLISH NAMES  fairy fan, yellow earthtongue, spatula fungus
NOTES  Features include a light yellow to cinnamon-buff fruiting body, a flattened, paddle-like or fan-like head that extends down opposite sides of stem, and microscopic characters including needle-like ascospores.^ There is a difference of opinion about whether Spathularia rufa Schmidel should be regarded as a separate species. Mains(3) said that various species including S. rufa Swartz had been distinguished from S. flavida mostly on account of differences in size and color of the ascocarps. He held that the importance of these criteria was doubtful and did not recognize the taxa. Hansen, L.(1) distinguishes Spathularia rufa Schmidel, on color but also on weak morphological features and micro features especially spore width: S. rufa has strongly compressed fruitbody, hymenium folded, decurrent, ochraceous, stem dirty grayish or yellowish brown, sometimes slightly striate (especially when dry), asci 65-110 x 8-12 microns, spores 32-50 x 1.5-2 microns, in mossy conifer forests; S. flavida has fruitbodies +/- compressed, hymenium somewhat decurrent, irregularly folded, pale or bright yellow, stem whitish or pale yellowish, more robust than in S. rufa, asci 73-125 x 10-19 microns, spores 37-62 x 2-3.5 microns.

SIMILAR  Elaphocordyceps longisegmentis is a similar species that has been confused with E. capitata in the past, with a distribution in Asia, Europe, and North America (collections examined from eastern North America). E. longisegmentis was distinguished by spore segments that were mostly 40-65 microns long. (Ginns(19)). Cordyceps canadensis Ellis & Everh. is said to have a different ectal layer on the cap from E. capitata, but the online Species Fungorum, accessed October 15, 2014, shows it as a synonym of E. capitata - this is the approach taken by Ginns(19).

NOTES  Features include a small, slender, club-shaped, brownish fruiting body with the head paler than the stem, arising from a dark brown to blackish sclerotium on winter cereals and grasses, and microscopic characters. It is quite similar to Typhula ishikariensis, and also with a similar sized dark brown to black sclerotium, but the fruitbody of T. idahoensis is brownish rather than powdery white to watery gray. T. idahoensis causes the disease variously called speckled snow mold, gray snow mold, snow scald, or Typhula blight (also caused by T. ishikariensis and T. incarnata). It can attack winter wheat in areas with prolonged snow cover. The name speckled snow mold comes from the appearance when snow is melting: patches of "mold" (mycelium) speckled with sclerotia.^ (Bruehl(1)).
