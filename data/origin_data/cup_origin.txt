NOTES  Features include a minute fruitbody on grasses and sedges, a pinkish spore-bearing surface, whitish marginal hairs, brick red exterior, and microscopic characters including lanceolate paraphyses.^ Haines examined 2 collections from Washington state, both of which "differed from the descriptions given by Dennis in being long-stipitate". Haines(1), probably referring to western Washington, said it is not uncommon on grasses and sedges. RANGE Albotricha albotestacea is found from NJ to WA, and also in Europe, (Seaver), WA (Kanouse), and Denmark, Finland, and Sweden, (Hansen).

ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  Features include minute, translucent-white cups on fern stems, hairs on margin and exterior, absent or inconspicuous stem, and microscopic characters including small rod-like spores and lanceolate paraphyses.^ Dennis(3) described Dasyscypha washingtonensis from part of the type collection of Hyalopeziza pteridis Kanouse Mycologia 39: 660. 1947 (= Lachnella pteridicola Seaver) - he emphasized the broadly lanceolate (not filiform) paraphyses which would not be consistent with Hyalopeziza, but he did not exclude the remote possibility of a mixed collection. Albotricha washingtonensis is not to be confused with Lachnella pteridis Phill., the name that forced the change of epithet to pteridicola when Seaver moved the species from Hyalopeziza to Lachnella. According to Haines(1), this is a common species in the spring in western Washington, "but it is easily overlooked due to its small size. It is only known from the fern Pteridium aquilinum.". RANGE A. washingtonensis was described from WA, and is found also in Europe. There is a collection by O. Ceska from BC at the University of British Columbia.

ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  Also listed in Jelly category. Features include top-shaped to disc-shaped or cup-shaped fruitbody that is purple to pink and gelatinous, stem lacking or short, tightly clustered growth on wood, and microscopic characters including ascospores 18-30 microns long that are multiseptate. Breitenbach & Kranzlin say it can be separated from Ascocoryne sarcoides only by the spore size.^ The same macroscopic description is given for both species, word for word (Breitenbach). It is common in the Pacific Northwest (Phillips). RANGE Phillips says in the North American context "Found in the Pacific Northwest and probably other areas."

ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  Atropellis piniphila is most easily differentiated from Atropellis pinicola by its spores. Features include growth on cankers of Ponderosa and lodgepole pine, the fruitbody first closed and rounded to ellipsoid, then expanding, 0.2-0.3cm across, brown to black, with leathery-membranaceous texture and a stem-like base, and microscopic characters, (Weir 1921).^ It attacks Pinus ponderosa and Pinus contorta between the ages of 5 and 25 years, the infection occurring usually at the nodes, less frequently on the internodes (but may spread throughout the length of the stem), and causes cankers on the surface. After further examination of Atropellis piniphila (Weir) M.L. Lohman & E.K. Cash and the type of Atropellis arizonica M.L. Lohman & E.K. Cash, the only feature that appeared to differ was the septation of the spores (0-1-septate for the former and 0-3-septate for the latter, not considered enough to define a new species in view of the small number of 3-septate spores examined), (Reid, J.). RANGE Collections of A. piniphila were examined from WA, ID, AB, MT, NM, and (the only collection corresponding to A. arizonica) AZ, (Reid, J.(2)). It causes considerable damage to Pinus contorta (lodgepole pine) in several areas of AB, BC, and the western United States (Hopkins(1)).

B. terrestris has fruitbodies gregarious on extensive mycelial mats, subiculum less than 2 mm thick, arachnoid, "covering and binding leaves, mosses, pine needles, and twigs and on soil in areas where animals have urinated", "dung sometimes present", spores 18.4-25.6 x 8-9.6(10.4) microns. B. cartilagineum [sic] has fruitbodies gregarious on extensive mycelial mats, subiculum 0.2-0.5cm thick, covering and binding rodent dung under or associated with melting snow, spores 20-24 x 8-9.6 microns. B. fusispora has fruitbodies formed on mycelial tufts, subiculum scanty or lacking, associated with burned areas, spores 24-28.8 x 7.2-11 microns (23-28 microns long in another part of the article), paraphyses straight or curved, not interwoven. B. seaveri has fruitbodies formed on mycelial tufts, subiculum scanty or lacking, on sandy soil often associated with burned plant debris, spores 29-36 x 8-10 microns, paraphyses sometimes interwoven to form a thin epithecium, (Pfister). Oluna and Adolf Ceska reported B. fusispora from Vancouver Island in British Columbia, with spore size (20)23-25 x 8-9(10) microns. According to Pfister(3), "Rifai (1968) largely discounted the use of ascospore size differences to distinguish species. He examined primarily type collections and proposed a broad species concept recognizing a single species Inermisia fusispora (Berk.) Rifai with a wide ascospore size range." .

Breitenbach(1) mention that their primary spore size was shorter than other measurements in the literature, "During the formation of secondary spores in the ascus, typical for C. atrovirens, the eight primary spores break up. The primary spores measured by us fall significantly short of the measurements given in the lit. (Rehm 1896: 15-25 x 3.5-5 um, Grelet 1932 - 1959: 20-35 x 4-5 um, Dennis 1956: 15-28 x 3.5-5 um).

NAME ORIGIN  
SIMILAR  Lachnum virgineum is similar or the same species as Dasyscyphella nivea: Seaver gives Lachnum niveum Karst. as a synonym of Lachnella virginea (Batsch) Phill. saying that none of the characters used to differentiate the two species appear to have any particular value (Phillips in British Discomycetes uses lanceolate paraphyses in L. virgineum, Rehm says they both have lanceolate paraphyses and uses other criteria, Gillet uses the form of the cup or length of hairs). However, the differentiation is maintained by such modern authors as Hansen, L.(1), Dennis(1), and Breitenbach(1) as follows. Lachnum virgineum has hairs that are granulose at the apex, whereas Dasyscyphella nivea has the apical 1-3 cells(s) of hairs smooth, also paraphyses of Lachnum virgineum are lanceolate, whereas those of Dasyscyphella nivea are cylindric to narrowly lanceolate, (Hansen). Lachnum virgineum has lanceolate paraphyses considerably longer than the asci, whereas Dasyscyphella nivea has filiform paraphyses, scarcely longer than the asci, as well as a different type of hairs on exterior, (Dennis). Lachnum virgineum has lanceolate paraphyses, hairs with blunt to slightly clavate tips, and grows on dead branches and twigs, Rubus canes, beechnut shells, cones, etc. but Dasyscyphella nivea has filiform paraphyses, hairs with slightly clavate and smooth tips, sometimes with the remains of an exudate, and grows primarily on wood, mostly oak, (Breitenbach). Kanouse records both species from WA without making clear what criteria she used to separate them: her collection of Lachnum niveum on Rubus species has lanceolate paraphyses, (Kanouse), characters that fit the modern concept of Lachnum virgineum better than Dasyscyphella nivea: the presence of Dasyscyphella nivea in the Pacific Northwest remains a subject of inquiry. Dasyscyphus montana Raitv. was collected from BC by O. Ceska, originally identified as D. nivea, but re-identified by her as D. montana. However, spores were measured at 8-11 x 2.5-3 microns, narrower than the measurements given in Raitviir(2): (5.0)7.1–7.8(9.0) × 1.8–2.2 microns.

NAME ORIGIN  means 'of pine'
SIMILAR  Lachnellula fuscosanguinea (Rehm) Dennis (=Dasyscyphus fuscosanguineus Rehm) is similar, and D. pini was recombined by Dennis as Lachnellula pini. There is debate about whether the two are one species and whether L. fuscosanguinea occurs in North America. Desjardin(6) reported the latter from California but it is not known whether they distinguish Dasyscyphus pini. They were maintained separately in the online Species Fungorum, accessed June 14, 2016. Hahn(1) regard Dasyscyphus fuscosanguineus as a saprophytic fungus occurring on pine in highlands of central Europe and say that whether it occurs in North America is problematic. According to W.W. Diehl, D. pini differs from D. fuscosanguineus in having definitely branched paraphyses, not thickened at the apex, spores that are often biseptate, and larger asci and spores. (Hahn(1)). Lachnellula arida (W. Phillips) Dennis has smaller spores and asci, and paraphyses with swollen tips, (W.W. Diehl in Hahn(1)).

NAME ORIGIN  
SIMILAR  Dermea padi (Alb. & Schwein.) Fr. (examined from NY, Austria) and Dermea cerasi (Pers.) Fr. are also found on Prunus: ascospore and ascus characters are similar and the characters that most clearly separate them are the size and shape of the conidia. In D. cerasi 1) the sexual fruitbodies, usually occurring in clusters, are relatively large, usually exceeding 0.1cm and often more than 0.15cm in diameter, 2) the conidial fruitbodies consist of fleshy stromata usually containing several cavities, and 3) the conidia are mostly 40-60 x 2.5-4.5 microns and sharply pointed at the ends. In Dermea padi, 1) the sexual fruitbodies are smaller, mostly about 0.1cm in diameter and mostly occurring singly, 2) the conidial fruitbodies consist of hard, horny, rostrate stromata, usually containing a single cavity, and 3) the conidia are similar in shape to those of D. cerasi but much smaller, 20-30 x 2.5-4.0 microns. In Dermea prunastri, 1) the sexual fruitbodies are usually in clusters, more brownish than those of the other 2 species, and usually less than 0.1cm in diameter, 2) the conidial fruitbodies are usually cespitose, long-rostrate, very hard and horny in consistency, and contain a single cavity, and 3) the conidia are 20-30 x 4-7 microns, about the same length as those of D. padi but thicker and not as sharply pointed at the ends.

ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  Also listed in Jelly category. Ditiola radicata is characterized by rooting fruiting bodies with a different microscopic structure in the cap and the stout stem, and tardily 1(2)-septate spores. Young fruiting bodies are often covered by a white "veil" before the spore-bearing surface develop. This description is for var. radicata. Var. gyrocephala is distinguished by more prominent stem, normally darker color, and 3-septate spores. (McNabb 1966).^ RANGE Var. radicata is found in BC, AB, NS, ON, AZ, CA, GA, IA, MA, MD, NC, NH, NY, OH, and VT, (Ginns), and the British Isles, Finland, France, Germany, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland, (McNabb). Var. gyrocephala is found in NS, ON, LA, MA, ME, MN, MS, NJ, NY, and SC, (Ginns). D. radicata is also found in Estonia and Russia, (Raitviir), and the United Kingdom (Reid, who notes that Lowy collections are suspect because they are said to have clamp connections).

NAME ORIGIN  means 'with a root'
SIMILAR  D. radicata may be confused with stemmed species of Dacrymyces, but it is readily distinguished microscopically by the difference in the structure of the cap and stem, (McNabb). Dacrymyces capitatus is very similar when immature, because the heterogeneous internal structure of Ditiola radicata does not become evident until late in development: the only sure way of distinguishing these two is to ensure that one has mature fruiting bodies while checking the internal structure, and the septation of the spores: those of Ditiola radicata are tardily 1-(2-)septate, and those of Dacrymyces capitatus are 3-septate with the septa often thickened, (Reid).

ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  The Geopyxis deceptiva group includes Geopyxis deceptiva, Geopyxis rehmii, and the extralimital Geopyxis alpina. The members are not readily distinguishable except by DNA and all used to be known under the name Geopyxis alpina or the name Geopyxis vulcanalis, but the isotype of G. vulcanalis has been determined to be a synonym of Geopyxis carbonaria. According to Wang, X.-H.(1), Geopyxis vulcanalis sensu Seaver likely refers to G. deceptiva or G. rehmii. The description here is for Geopyxis deceptiva by Wang, X.-H.(1). In the Pacific Northwest, Geopyxis collections may be determined with confidence as Geopyxis carbonaria if long-stemmed and on burned areas. PNW collections may be determined with confidence as Geopyxis deceptiva group if without a stem and off burned areas, or even (as is more common) on burned areas if stem is absent and spores mostly average about 16.7 microns long. Placement of the genus in Pyronemataceae is not certain. RANGE Collections of Geopyxis deceptiva were examined from OR, CO (including type), and CA (Wang, X.-H.(1)). Collections of Geopyxis rehmii were examined from WA, OR, ID, Poland (type), and Kyrgyzstan. Collections of Geopyxis alpina sensu stricto were examined from Austria, Czech Republic, Cyprus, France, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and China, (Wang, X.-H.(1)).

HABITAT  scattered or gregarious, often on burned ground, rarely from unburned ground, collections June, July, September, (Wang, X.-H.(1) for G. deceptiva), Geopyxis rehmii was described as a species from burned ground. In comparison with G. carbonaria it was also recognized "to have a lower tolerance to burn conditions", and fruitbodies "developed later (in second year) and toward the edge of the burns, until pH values had lowered in the center (in third year)". "Our data from broad sampling show that this species occurs on both burned and unburned places." In Poland it is restricted to mountain areas, "which may also be the case in North America (based on the localities in the material examined by us).", collections June, July, September, (Wang, X.-H.(1) for G. rehmii)

(Wang, X.-H. whose figure shows spore sizes for 8 collections averaging 15..3-17.2 x 8.5-9.5 microns)
NAME ORIGIN  "For being deceptive in comparison with G. alpina and G. rehmii, and because mycologists were deceived to believe it represented G.  vulcanalis" (Wang, X.-H.(1), Latin names italicized)
SIMILAR  Fruitbodies of Geopyxis carbonaria are most often clearly stemmed (stem 0.1-1.4cm long), habitat is burned ground, and spore size is 12.0-13.5-16.5-18.0 x 6.5-7.4-9.6-11.0 microns, whereas in G. deceptiva stem is 0.05-0.3 long if present, and spore length is mostly > 15 microns, (Wang, X.-H(1)) [The criterion actually given in the key for G. carbonaria and G. delectans together is "Apothecia almost exclusively on burned ground, clearly stipitate, often with long stipes, or sessile, broadly attached to the substrate; spore length mostly <15 um (mean length <= 14.6 um)", (Wang, X.-H(1) with conventional symbols for mu and <=). This would seem to imply that the mean length <=14.6 um applies also to G. carbonaria which seems doubtful with the spore dimensions given - perhaps it is a matter of punctuation.] Geopyxis delectans, which occurs as close as Colorado, is sessile but broadly instead of narrowly attached to the substrate, it has spore length mostly < 15 microns (11.0-12.2-13.9-15.0 x 6.0-7.3-8.3-9.5 microns), and habitat is burned ground (Wang, X.-H(1)).

NAME ORIGIN  
SIMILAR  Disciotis venosa is more cup-like and more veined, sometimes has a chlorine odor, and has smooth spores without large oil droplets (but sometimes small droplets at ends outside the spore wall). Discina leucoxantha is yellowish, has somewhat different spores, and is found under both hardwoods and conifers, (Arora). D. leucoxantha has a bright yellow brown to orange brown fresh upper surface and the spore apiculi are depressed (concave-truncate, each appearing as if there are two points instead of one), (Abbott). Gyromitra melaleucoides has a somewhat waxy-looking underside when moist, a sometimes slightly longer narrower stem, and much shorter non-apiculate spores, (Arora). Gyromitra olympiana is smaller, with different spores (strongly three-sided, in one view narrow and in another almost diamond-shaped), whereas spores of G. ancilis are narrowly fusoid and have prominent apiculi, (Kanouse(6) discussing Discina olympiana and Discina perlata). Some spores of Gyromitra olympiana have a broad blunt thickening at both ends. Spores of Gyromitra ancilis, Gyromitra olympiana, Gyromitra leucoxantha, and Gyromitra melaleucoides should be mature spores from a spore deposit when comparison is made (Michael Beug, pers. comm.)

SIMILAR  Donk writes of Lachnella villosa, "The fruit-body is on an average much smaller and more tender than in Lachnella alboviolascens, and closes less perfectly to a globular body. The latter species has a more fleshy disc which almost invariably (at least in not too proliferous fruit-bodies) turns dark. The presence of numerous 'basidioles' [in L. villosa] may be another important difference. Finally, L. villosa prefers herbaceous or only slightly woody substrata, while L. alboviolascens grows almost invariably on woody substrata (though these may be very thin branches).", (Donk(1), with Latin names in italics), L. villosa usually occurs on herbaceous stems and has a whiter spore-bearing surface, slightly smaller spores, and spear-shaped cystidia, (Buczacki), L. villosa has thinner hymenium.

SIMILAR  Lachnellula flavovirens was collected from BC and WA and deposited by O. Ceska at the University of British Columbia. This species and Lachnellula arida are shown on the same page in Breitenbach(1) who give the spore measurements as 10-13 x 3.5-5.5 microns for L. flavovirens and say the margin is "thickly set with cinnamon-brown hairs". Lachnellula fuscosanguinea (Rehm) Dennis is illustrated by Desjardin(6) for California. Habitat is bark of dead conifer branches including pine, external hairs are yellowish brown to rusty brown as opposed to dark brown for L. arida, and spores are larger, measuring 13-15 x 4-5 microns. (Desjardin(6)). See also Dasyscyphus pini which might be the same species as L. fuscosanguinea. D. pini has larger spores and asci, and paraphyses lack swollen tips, (W.W. Diehl in Hahn(1)). Several Lachnum species also have brown hairs but are generally smaller, often with lanceolate paraphyses. See descriptions for Lachnum cerinum, Lachnum clandestinum, and Lachnum flavofuligineum. According to Haines(1), Brunnipila calyculiformis (=Lachnum calyculiforme, =Dasyscyphus calyculiformis) was reported from WA by Kanouse but Seaver stated that there was some doubt about the determination. There is a D. Stuntz collection from WA at the University of Washington. Haines(1) reported two collections from WA with the reservation that the hairs were longer (up to 200 microns) than Dennis's description and there was no color reaction with the hairs in KOH. Haines(1) reported from WA one collection of yet another brown-haired species, Lachnum fuscescens, "easily recognized by its thick-walled hairs, tipped with crystal masses". Haines(1) further reports from WA, a collection of Brunnipila palearum (=Lachnum palearum, =Dasyscyphus palearum) "striking in its appearance" due to the presence on the tips of the brown hairs of yellowish crystal masses which contrast with the brown exterior of the cup and give the cup a frosty appearance. Haines(1) examined a collection of Lachnum barbatum (as Dasyscyphus barbatus, also known as Trichopezizella barbata) from before 1942 by J.W. Hotson on Oplopanax horridus (devil's club). It has large, smooth, dark brown hairs 4-5 microns wide, up to 250 microns long, some with swollen tips, others with tapering tips. See also Lasiobelonium spp.

NAME ORIGIN  probably referring to the long hairs (ciliate)
SIMILAR  Lachnellula agassizii differs in spore characters (smaller) "and in the size of its fruit cups"; an imperfect stage "which is present in the life-history of D. Agassizii is apparently lacking in the life-history of this new Douglas fir species"; Lachnellula agassizii grows not only on small branches, but also on large trunks, (Hahn, Latin name italicized). Lachnellula pseudotsugae has smaller spores and a conspicuous imperfect stage: it grows on cankers and roughened bark occurring on the living trunks and branches of Douglas-fir (saplings and trees of pole-size that are suppressed or growing on poor sites), (Hahn).

NOTES  Features include a minute, pale orange cup clothed with dense short white hairs, pale orange spore-bearing surface, growth on salal leaves on large, semicircular spots that are pinkish gray to grayish white on the upper surface and rusty brown on the lower surface, with a dark purple border, and microscopic characters.^ According to Zeller, this species is closely related to Trichopeziza echinulata Rehm. Dennis(3) regarded the status of this taxon as dubious based on the differentiation from Dasyscyphus albocitrinus using the short spores 4-5 x 1.25 microns and his observation of specimens determined as L. gaultheriae with spores up to 8 x 1.5 microns. (The hairs of D. albocitrinus are also slender, tapering, thin-walled, and hyaline, but he gives the spores of D. albocitrinus as 10-11 x 1-1.5 microns in another part of the paper.) L. gaultheriae is common according to Zeller(14) writing about the Pacific Northwest. RANGE Lachnum gaultheriae was described from WA and found there also by Kanouse. It is found from WA to OR and CA (Seaver).

NAME ORIGIN  
SIMILAR  Lachnum pygmaeum has similar hairs but is much larger and almost bald at maturity, and has long-stalked asci, (Haines(1)). |Dasyscyphella nivea (R. Hedw.: Fr.) Raitv. is similar or the same species as L. virgineum: Seaver gives Lachnum niveum Karst. as a synonym of Lachnella virginea (Batsch) Phill. saying that none of the characters used to differentiate the two species appear to have any particular value (Phillips in British Discomycetes uses lanceolate paraphyses in L. virgineum, Rehm says they both have lanceolate paraphyses and uses other criteria, Gillet uses the form of the cup or length of hairs). However, the differentiation is maintained by such modern authors as Hansen, L.(1), Dennis(1), and Breitenbach(1) as follows. Lachnum virgineum has hairs that are granulose at apex, whereas Dasyscyphella nivea has the apical 1-3 cells(s) of hairs smooth, also paraphyses of Lachnum virgineum are lanceolate, whereas those of Dasyscyphella nivea are cylindric to narrowly lanceolate, (Hansen). Lachnum virgineum has lanceolate paraphyses considerably longer than the asci, whereas Dasyscyphella nivea has filiform paraphyses, scarcely longer than the asci, as well as a different type of hairs on exterior, (Dennis). Lachnum virgineum has lanceolate paraphyses, hairs with blunt to slightly clavate tips, and grows on dead branches and twigs, Rubus canes, beechnut shells, cones, etc. but Dasyscyphella nivea has filiform paraphyses, hairs with slightly clavate and smooth tips, sometimes with the remains of an exudate, and grows primarily on wood, mostly oak, (Breitenbach). Kanouse records both species from WA without making clear what criteria she used to separate them: her collection of Lachnum niveum on Rubus species has lanceolate paraphyses, (Kanouse), characters that fit the modern concept of Lachnum virgineum better than Dasyscyphella nivea: the presence of Dasyscyphella nivea in the Pacific Northwest remains uncertain. |Lachnum brevipilosum has been identified by O. Ceska and deposited at the University of British Columbia. Haines(1) also examined L. brevipilosum from western Washington. He says it is related to L. virgineum, but differs in its shorter hairs measuring 40-50(70) microns long, smaller spores measuring 5 x 3.5-4 microns (clavate), and yellower hymenium (drying to light yellow), and does not have the ragged appearance of L. virgineum. |Haines(1) examined 2 collections from Washington State of Dasyscyphus pudicellus (current name Lachnum tenuissimum (Quel.) Korf & W.Y. Zhuang) on grasses. He said the short-stemmed cups were up to 0.5cm across, entirely cream-white "densely covered with short, white glassy-appearing hairs", the spores 7-10 x 1.5-2.0 microns, fusiform to naviculate, the broadly lanceolate paraphyses 4-5 microns at widest point, exceeding asci by up to 25 microns, hairs 35-65 x 2.5-3.0 microns, conspicuously swollen at tip to 4.5-5.0 microns, finely granulate for their full length. |Haines(1) also reported a collection of Lachnum roridum (as Dasyscyphus roridus), on thimbleberry stems, "made distinctive by large crystal formations on the tips of its hairs, and by the large size of its paraphyses". He says the short-stemmed cups are up to 0.07cm across, cream-colored on disc and exterior, the exterior densely covered by white-appearing hairs, the spores 6-8(1) x 1.5-2.0 microns, narrowly fusiform, the broadly lanceolate paraphyses 4-6 microns wide at widest point, 70-100 microns long, exceeding asci by up to 50 microns, and colorless, the hairs 50-70 x 4.5-5.0 microns, usually capped by crystal masses up to 7 microns across, cylindric, "sometimes with very slightly enlarged tips", colorless, "thin-walled, finely but conspicuously roughened", 1 or 2 septate. |See also Psilachnum inquilinum on Equisetum under Roseodiscus subcarneus.

LATIN NAMES  Monilinia oxycocci  (Woronin) Honey^  Am. Jour. Bot. 23: 105. 1936;  Sclerotinia oxycocci  Woronin
ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  Monilinia oxycocci produces a reddish brown cup, disc, or reflexed cup, with a long thin stem, on overwintered mummified cranberries (Vaccinium macrocarpon).^ Ascospores infect cranberry shoots and about 3-4 weeks later conidia start to form on the shoots. The conidia disperse, grow to penetrate the ovaries of the flowers, and thereby infect the berries. Young infected cranberry shoots show "tip blight" symptoms: "shriveled shoot tips resemble a shepherd's crook and a tan discoloration spreads from the tip of the shoot down the stem and into leaves"; "To distinguish cottonball tip blight from other shoot diebacks, check the leaves for tan V-shaped or U-shaped lesions centered on the leaf midvein"; "Another indicator is the presence of masses of white, powdery spores (conidia) that appear on diseased shoots just before and during bloom"; "Cottonball tip blight is often inconspicuous and can easily be overlooked"; "Immature diseased berries show no external symptoms, but are filled with the white, cotton-like fungus"; "Healthy berries turn red as they mature; diseased berries may acquire a red blush but are generally yellowish with tan stripes or blotches". (McManus). The distribution is "where the cranberry is cultivated" (Seaver). McManus(1) writes that cottonball, a disease caused by this fungus, fills berries with a cotton-like fungus that makes them unmarketable. It is an economically important disease on many cranberry marshes in Wisconsin. Typically, 2 to 10% of the fruit in diseased beds is infected; if left unchecked the amount can exceed 40%. Cottonball also occurs in the Pacific Northwest and southeastern Canada but losses in those areas have generally been minor. RANGE The online Pacific Northwest Plant Disease Management Handbook, accessed December 22, 2013, says that this disease was a problem in WA during the 1920s and 1930s but is rarely found now, except in BC where it is still considered an economic problem. Monilinia oxycocci also occurs in Europe including Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland (Hansen), as well as WI as mentioned above (McManus).

NOTES  Monilinia urnula produces shallowly cup-shaped to flat, dark brown fruiting bodies on fallen mummified Vaccinium berries in spring and early summer. It causes mummyberry disease of blueberries (along with Monilinia vaccinii-corymbosi) which became serious in the Puget Sound area of Washington in the early 1960s and was soon present up and down the coast wherever blueberries were grown. The fungus causes a blossom blast [destruction of blossom buds] in addition to blight of young twigs and leaves, the fruit becoming a mummy that falls to the ground and creates new infections the following spring.^ Note the difference in the width of the fruitbody given by Dennis(1) and by Hansen, L.(1).

SIMILAR  Myriosclerotinia sulcatula T. Schumach. & L.M. Kohn (= Sclerotinia sulcata Whetzel) has been documented from NY (holotype) and Europe. Ascospores in M. sulcatula, though similar in size measuring 11.1-17.1 x 5.3-7.5 microns, are regularly elliptic to slightly inequilateral, whereas in M. duriaeana they are strongly inequilateral to cymbiform [boat-shaped]. The asci of M. sulcatula are consistently longer (150-210 microns) than those of M. duriaeana (130-175 microns). The locules of the microconidial anamorph are irregularly scattered on the culm in M. sulcatula, but they are uniformly in pairs at more or less regular intervals along the culm in M. duriaeana. The dimensions of the sclerotium are similar measuring 0.3-2.5cm x 0.15-0.4cm, (Schumacher). Myriosclerotinia caricis-ampullaceae, which also grows on Carex, has sclerotia measuring 3-17 x 0.6-1.5cm.

LATIN NAMES  Neofabraea populi  G.E. Thomps.^  Mycologia 31: 458. 1939;  Pezicula populi  (Thompson) Seaver
ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  Key diagnostic features are the brownish to amber colored, cushion-shaped fruitbodies, erumpent whitish conidial stage, large granular conidia, and growth on Populus.^ It may cause serious canker formation in native and exotic poplars, especially hybrids and young nursery stock. Cankered areas "first appear slightly more sunken than surrounding tissue, and bark may be discolored orange", acervuli then develop "in concentric waves around the points of inoculation, usually around a lenticel", (Callan). Some authorities regard this as a Pezicula species: Seaver transferred it to Pezicula, and according to Dictionary of the Fungi 10th Edition, molecular data do not support separation of Neofabraea from Pezicula. RANGE At the time of Seaver's description, it was known only from the type locality in ON (Seaver), but it is now known more widely, including BC, Europe, and Japan (Callan).
CHEMICAL REACTIONS  
UPPER SURFACE  apothecia (fruitbody) 0.05-0.2cm across, disc-shaped to cushion-shaped, fleshy; pale brown to amber; acervuli 0.05-0.15cm across and up to 0.005cm thick, "they first appear as pimple-like protrusions before they rupture the epidermis to expose their whitish to yellowish surface"^, (Callan), scarcely exceeding 0.05cm across, erumpent [emerging from the bark] but scarcely rising above the surface, surrounded with the upturned edges of the ruptured outer bark; dark brownish black; spore-bearing surface concave or nearly flat, reddish brown with a slightly elevated darker center that gives the spore-bearing surface an umbilicate appearance, (Seaver)

NOTES  Orbilia species have tiny fruitbodies that are typically brightly colored or white, thin, waxy in consistency, and smooth, often appearing translucent/glassy. They have little or no stem and grow on wood, herbaceous stems, or old pyrenomycetes. Microscopically, they are characterized by small spores and paraphyses that are abruptly swollen at the tips.^ Orbilia species occur in the Pacific Northwest but are sparsely documented. The University of British Columbia has collections from BC labeled Orbilia coccinella by R. Bandoni (1959) and J. Reeve (1960), as well as a collection labeled as Orbilia auricolor by S.

ENGLISH NAMES  brown clustered ear cup
NOTES  {See also Otidea Table.} Features include a lopsided cup-shaped fruitbody with a shorter side that is split lengthwise, an interior spore surface colored tan to grayish brown or yellowish brown, a similarly colored exterior that is often slightly scurfy, brittle yellowish flesh, a short stem-like base (usually present), growth on the ground in woods often along roadsides, and microscopic characters.^ |Kanouse describes a variety microspora with paler and more yellow color and smaller spores (9-10 x 5.5-6.5 microns) from Washington and California: it was later raised to species status as Otidea microspora (but see SIMILAR section). |She lists var. typica from WA and CA also. |Olariaga(1) consider Otidea alutacea sensu lato to comprise a species complex. We are using the term Otidea alutacea group to represent this Otidea alutacea complex. Their molecular study resolved several clades. "It appears that the spore sizes within each clade have a fairly narrow range, but overlap exists between the clades. Patterns of continental speciation are suggested as well; two clades have North American specimens (clades 2, 4), and the rest contain samples from Europe and Asia" (Otidea alutacea sensu stricto and clades 1, 3a, and 3b). The two North American clades, with non-overlapping spore lengths, correspond to the two species distinguished by Peterson, E.T.(1) as O. alutacea (clade 2) and O. umbrina (clade 4). "Clades 2 and 4 have spores that overlap with European clades, and it is so far problematic to distinguish them using only morphology and disregarding the geographical origin." |E.T. Peterson(1) distinguished the two on the basis of the color of the hymenium in dried specimens: for the long-spored taxon "tawny olive", "sayal brown", or "raw umber", and for the short-spored taxon "pale horn color", "drab-gray", lighter than "chamois" or "tawny olive". Peterson further distinguished the two by saying that in the long-spored taxon the exterior lost color slowly on drying whereas in the short-spored taxon the exterior lost color quickly on drying. Peterson also says  (italicizing the Latin names), "O. alutacea tends to be lighter in color and more brittle than O. umbrina and has slightly larger spores", but does not specify whether this refers to fresh or dried specimens. |The Otidea alutacea complex needs more research before names can be assigned to different species. |Olariaga(1) give a detailed description of Otidea alutacea sensu stricto in Europe. The descriptions of Breitenbach(1), Dennis(1), and Hansen, L.(1) would also be describing European members of the group. |RANGE Collections in the different clades were examined by Olariaga(1) from WA (4 collections), OR (1 collection) (clade 2), OR (10 collections) (clade 4), Denmark, France, Italy, Norway, Spain, and Sweden (O. alutacea s.str.), Denmark and Sweden (clade 1), Norway and Sweden (clade 3a), and Denmark and Sweden (clade 3b). According to Larsen(1), Otidea alutacea is found in WA, ID, AB, and CA. There are collections from BC at the University of British Columbia by Paul Kroeger and Pam Janszen.

SIMILAR  Otidea microspora has smaller spores that measure 9-10 x 5-6.5 microns (Kanouse(4)). Harmaja(7) raised this to species status from a variety of O. alutacea with the words "By the virtue of its pale yellow more or less truncate apothecia and very short spores this taxon no doubt deserves to be recognized at the specific level.". However, according to Olariaga(1), considering the two collections that Kanouse designated as the type, A.H. Smith 9351 has far larger spores than stated in the protologue (13-15.5 x 7-8 microns versus 9-10 x 5.5-6.5 microns) - there are indications that it belongs to the O. alutacea complex. A.H. 17699 has spores that match the original description. Its shape is similar to that of O. rainierensis. A Gen-Bank ITS sequence of a paratype of O. microspora (A.H. Smith 30502) differs by only 1 base pair from the ITS sequence of the holotype of O. rainierensis. Olariaga(1) as a result treat the name Otidea microspora as doubtful for the time being.

NOTES  {See also Otidea Table.} We follow the Olariaga concept of the species which has not been documented to occur in North America. Features include a lemon yellow lop-sided cup that is slit laterally and somewhat inrolled, an inner spore-bearing surface sometimes with reddish tinges, an absent to short stem lighter than the rest of the fruitbody, and microscopic characters.^ Otidea concinna (Pers.) Sacc. was listed in the online Species Fungorum, accessed May 7, 2015, as a synonym of Flavoscypha cantharella (Fr.) Harmaja, but Harmaja(3)(2009) considered Otidea concinna (Pers.) Sacc. to be a separate species from the original Peziza cantharella Fr. (a taiga species "with a European distribution essentially restricted to the northeastern part of the continent, with some occurrences on the mountains of Central Europe") and lists the two as separate species of Otidea. Also, Liu(2)(2006) presents molecular data indicating that Flavoscypha cantharella represents a genus inseparable from Otidea. At least one of their specimens of Flavoscypha cantharella had been identified as Otidea concinna, suggesting that they were using Harmaja's 1974 concept. To make things more complicated, Harmaja(3) considers the variability of Otidea concinna to have included two other species, Otidea integra (Bres.) Harmaja 1986 and Otidea subconcinna nom. prov., the latter a truncate rather than ear-shaped variation with subtle microscopic differences. Olariaga(1) describe an O. concinna clade that includes O. oregonensis, which they describe as a new species, and O. rainierensis. But in the absence of extant type material for Otidea concinna, they select a particular plate as lectotype, because it most closely resembles Persoon's description, "showing two or more large, convolute, caespitose, sessile, cup-shaped apothecia with a citrine (though light) outer surface." They assign only European collections to their concept. RANGE Otidea concinna has been reported in Washington, Idaho, and California, (Larsen), and Washington, Idaho, and Sweden, (Kanouse). One of the Washington specimens examined by Kanouse is however assigned to Otidea pseudoleporina by Olariaga(1) in their description of the latter as a new species, and the Idaho collection was originally assigned to O. leporina. There are collections designated as this species from Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and California at Oregon State University.

NOTES  {See also Otidea Table.} Otidea leporina is characterized by an ear-shaped fruitbody that is brown inside and out and wide spores. (Olariaga(1)).^ This name has been used for yellow fruitbodies in North America, but although it can be yellowish brown, the predominant colors are shades of brown - it is probably the most common Otidea species in the coniferous forests of Europe. Harmaja(3) comments (with Latin italicized), "According to Franchi et al. (1999) Peziza leporina Batsch : Fr. should be typified with a fungus that is currently known as Helvella silvicola (Beck ex Sacc.) Harmaja. The former name would be the oldest one for this fungus, and consequently these authors made the new combination Helvella leporina (Batsch : Fr.) Franchi, L. Lami & M. Marchetti. If this is accepted, a valid specific epithet for the present Otidea species should be searched for (if in existence)." RANGE Collections were examined from WA, OR, CA, CO, QC, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Norway, and Sweden, (Olariaga(1)). Distribution may be much wider in North America. Besides var. typicus described below for WA, OR, CO, MD, and NY, Kanouse also records var. minor, with spores 8-11 x 5-6 microns and smaller asci, from WA, OR, CA, Michigan, and NY.

SIMILAR  Otidea tuomikoskii is similar. 1) Warts are higher (55-177 microns) and denser on the exterior of O. tuomikoskii than on the exterior of O. nannfeldtii which has warts 45-85 microns high. 2) O. tuomikoskii has orange ocher to ocher basal tomentum, whereas O. nannfeldtii lacks orange tones in the basal tomentum which is white to light yellow or ocher. 3) Pink stains do occur in O. tuomikoskii but rarely. (The hymenium of O. nannfeldtii sometimes has pink tones or is entirely pinkish.) 4) In O. tuomikoskii (unlike O. nannfeldtii) the excipulum (exterior layer) turns yellow with KOH under the microscope though sometimes weakly. In recent fresh collections the reaction can be seen macroscopically. 5) The paraphyses of O. tuomikoskii sometimes have up to 2 shallow notches, which has not been observed to occur in O. nannfeldtii (rarely they do have slightly swollen areas). 6) Resinous exudates on surface cells of the exterior of O. tuomikoskii are yellow orange to yellow brown and the color does not change in KOH. Resinous exudates on the surface cells of the exterior of O. nannfeldtii are yellow brown and turn reddish brown in KOH. (Olariaga(1)). Otidea pseudoleporina has an ocher-orange to pinkish orange interior, narrowly to broadly ear-shaped young fruitbodies, and resinous exudates on the exterior dissolve partially to entirely into reddish gray heterogeneous drops in KOH.

ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  {See also Otidea Table.} Otidea propinquata is unlike other Otidea species in the Pacific Northwest in its stemmed cup fruitbody without a split in the side. The cup is ocher brown to dark reddish brown inside and a similar color outside, the stem appears whitish in the Olariaga(1) illustration, spores are large, and paraphyses are often forked or notched.^ Some early authors used the name O. abietina, but that name is considered a nomen ambiguum by Olariaga(1). The name O. abietina was also used for the European species Otidea cantharella by Breitenbach(1). The description is derived from Olariaga(1). RANGE Collections were examined from WA, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Italy, and Sweden (Olariaga(1)), but the WA collection was not included in the molecular study.
CHEMICAL REACTIONS  
UPPER SURFACE  1.5-3.5cm across, 0.7-2.0cm high, obconic to broadly cup-shaped, "entire, very rarely split, regular or sometimes undulate in the margin"; ocher brown to dark reddish brown, when dried ocher brown
FLESH  
UNDERSIDE  "concolorous", slightly hygrophanous, orange-brown, in drying yellowish brown, when dried orange-brown; "furfuraceous to warty, sometimes wrinkled at the base", warts hemispheric [also referred to as conic], "gregarious, concolorous, sometimes darker than the background, brown"

ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  {See also Otidea Table.} Otidea pseudoleporina is recognized by broadly ear-shaped fruitbodies, ocher-orange to pinkish orange interior and small spores (Olariaga(1)). The exterior is hygrophanous ocher-brown, furfuraceous to finely warty, and sometimes wrinkled at the base. Stem is present or absent.^ RANGE Collections were examined from WA, OR, ID, and CA.
CHEMICAL REACTIONS  
UPPER SURFACE  0.8-2.2(3.1)cm across, 1.0-3.0(5.0)cm tall, "initially narrowly to broadly ear-shaped, margin rounded, then expanding and sometimes becoming irregularly cup-shaped, split"; ocher-orange to pinkish orange, "sometimes with pink spots or stains", when dried orange-ocher to reddish brown

EDIBILITY  
HABITAT  gregarious under conifers (conifers at least mentioned when habitat specified for collections examined), fruiting from September to November in the collections examined, except for one collection each from March, May, August, and December
SPORE DEPOSIT  
MICROSCOPIC  spores (9.5)10-12(12.5) x 5.5-6.5 microns, elliptic, smooth, colorless, "sometimes slightly inequilateral", with 2 large droplets, sometimes with up to 4 smaller droplets^; asci presumably 8-spored, 155-231 x 9-10 microns; paraphyses "curved to hooked, of the same width or slightly enlarged at apices", 2.5-4.5 microns wide, "sometimes with 1-3 notches", apices seldom forked and rarely covered with a colorless coating, "when dried containing small, refractive, yellow granules"; warts 77-115 microns high, broadly conic, "formed by short, fasciculate, hyphoid hairs, of 2-3 subglobose to elongated cells, constricted at septa", 6-12 microns wide, "sometimes with a gelatinous sheath"; resinous exudates "abundant, yellow-brown", dissolving into amber droplets in Melzer's reagent, "partially to completely dissolving" into reddish gray heterogeneous droplets in KOH
NAME ORIGIN  means false (Otidea) leporina, referring to a close relationship with that species
SIMILAR  Otidea leporina shares an ear-shaped fruitbody and resinous exudates on the outer surface that partly convert to heterogeneous reddish droplets in KOH, but differs in the brown fruitbodies and larger, broadly elliptic spores, (Olariaga(1)). Otidea nannfeldtii has the same general shape and small spores but has narrowly ear-shaped young fruitbodies, most often lacking orange tones, and ectal excipular resinous exudates turn reddish brown in KOH, (Olariaga(1))

LATIN NAMES  Otidea rainierensis  Kanouse^  Mycologia 41: 674. 1949
ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  {See also Otidea Table.} Otidea rainierensis is characterized by its relatively large size for an Otidea and paraphyses that are slender but enlarge abruptly into an almost spherical head.^ Olariaga(1) suggest that Otidea kauffmanii Kanouse is a synonym, based on molecular and morphological study of both types. Their ITS sequences of the two types differ by only 4 base pairs. That would be a clue to the fresh colors of Otidea rainierensis, since the fresh outside (underside) of O. kauffmanii was described by Kanouse(4) as "chamois" to "ochraceous", and the fresh hymenium as "cream buff". The fruitbodies of O. kauffmanii were also described as 'yellowish tan to yellowish buff, concolorous', the 'concolorous' apparently referring to the exterior being the same color as the interior. Olariaga(1) believe that O. rainierensis does have yellow tones, as they observed small yellow resinous exudates in the type. Smaller spore size was described by Kanouse for O. kauffmanii - 8-10(12) x 5-6(7) microns. Olariaga(1) measured the spore size of the type of O. kauffmanii at 11.5-12.5 x 5.5-6.5 microns, the length of which overlaps their measurements for the type of O. rainierensis. RANGE Otidea rainierensis was described from a dried collection from WA, and there have been other reports since (Nancy Weber, pers. comm.). If O. kauffmanii is a synonym, it is also found at least in Michigan.

LATIN NAMES  Otidea tuomikoskii  Harmaja^  Karstenia 15: 30. 1976
ENGLISH NAMES  tall rabbit's-ear
NOTES  {See also Otidea Table.} Otidea tuomikoskii is characterized by the narrowly ear-shaped fruitbody, with high warts on the outside, small spores, and the outer layer almost always turning yellow in KOH, together with the ocher to orange-ocher basal tomentum in dried specimens, (Olariaga(1)). The color is yellowish brown on outer and inner surfaces. It is associated with conifers and fruits most often among needle litter or even on very decayed wood.^ The description is derived from Olariaga(1). RANGE Collections were examined from WA, OR, CA, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Norway, Spain, and Sweden, (Olariaga). It has also been found in Asia (Cao et al. 1990).
CHEMICAL REACTIONS  "The yellow KOH reaction of the excipulum, especially strong in the subhymenium and ectal excipulum, has been observed to be constant, although weak in some collections. The KOH reaction is stronger in recent collections, and can also be macroscopically observed in fresh apothecia."  
UPPER SURFACE  0.7-3.0cm across, 1.7-6.0cm tall, "long and narrowly ear-shaped, split"; pale whitish ocher to ocher yellow, rarely with pink stains; when dried light ocher yellow to ocher

NAME ORIGIN  after R. Tuomikoski, the name associated with the type collection
SIMILAR  Otidea nannfeldtii is probably the closest species in appearance. 1) Warts are lower (45-85 microns high) and less dense on the exterior of O. nannfeldtii than on the exterior of O. tuomikoskii which has warts 55-177 microns high. 2) O. nannfeldtii lacks orange tones in basal tomentum which is white to light yellow or ocher whereas O. tuomikoskii has orange ocher to light ocher basal tomentum. 3) The hymenium sometimes has pink tones or is entirely pinkish in O. nannfeldtii. Pink stains do occur rarely in O. tuomikoskii. 4) In O. nannfeldtii the excipulum (exterior layer) does not turn yellow with KOH under the microscope. 5) The paraphyses of O. nannfeldtii do not have shallow notches (rarely they do have slightly swollen areas). 6) Resinous exudates on the surface cells of the exterior of O. nannfeldtii are yellow brown and turn reddish brown in KOH, whereas resinous exudates on surface cells of the exterior of O. tuomikoskii are yellow orange to yellow brown and the color does not change in KOH.

LATIN NAMES  Otidea unicisa  (Peck) Harmaja^  Karstenia 26(2): 44. 1986;  Sowerbyella unicisa  (Peck) J. Moravec
ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  {See also Otidea Table.} Otidea unicisa is distinguished from all other species of Otidea by its delicately ornamented spore wall, (Harmaja 1986), but the species has not been established for the Pacific Northwest.^ This name is being used, following Harmaja(3), as the most likely correct name for records of Otidea grandis (Pers.) Rehm Bull. Soc. mycol. Fr. 9: 111 (1893) or its synonym Scodellina grandis (Pers.) Seaver. According to Harmaja(3), Moravec(1994) considered it a Sowerbyella species, on the basis of that the secondary spore wall was persistent rather than temporary, but Harmaja disagreed, finding the excipular anatomy and split apothecium to be typical of Otidea and noting that it lacks the distinct stipe and hairs on the exterior typical of the Sowerbyella genus. The online Species Fungorum, accessed July 1, 2012, listed the current name as Sowerbyella unicisa (Peck) J. Moravec, Czech Mycol. 47(4): 266 (1995) [1994]. Olariaga(1) say that the name O. grandis has been used for O. unicisa in Kanouse(1949) as well as for O. bufonia, and they regard the name as a nomen dubium and confusum. They also say that O. unicisa has not been recorded outside eastern North America. RANGE Otidea grandis has been reported from Washington and Idaho in Larsen(1) (though not verified by either author). Kanouse gives the distribution as NY, NS, MI, and Europe. Phillips lists it for northeastern North America and Seaver(1) for CT to PA and WI as well as Europe. Harmaja saw specimens from MA, NH, NY, PA, and VT. Olariaga(1) examined collections from MA, MI, NC, NH, and WV and say it has not been recorded outside eastern North America. The type is from NY.

SIMILAR  Pachyella adnata is up to 5cm across, flat, sometimes becoming convoluted, appressed to the substrate, when old sometimes becoming shallow cup-shaped, colored umber to sepia, black when dried; it has spores 18-20 x 10-12(14) microns, that are elliptic, distinctly verrucose (with long blunt warts exceeding 1 micron long), thin-walled, colorless, and with 1-2 oil droplets. Psilopezia nummularia was reported from WA and ID in Larsen(1) but not confirmed by either author. P. nummularia is barely distinguishable macroscopically, but has a negative iodine reaction in the asci and the excipulum has an exterior of radial, slender, interwoven hyphae and a medulla of textura intricata, (as opposed to Pachyella babingtonii with rounded cells in exterior part, and the medulla a very loose textura intricata), (Breitenbach). Pachyella clypeata "is macroscopically nearly identical" to P. adnata - compared with P. babingtonii it has a larger (0.5-4cm) "reddish brown fruitbody, later tinted olive then greenish-black and without luster" but has smooth spores with 1-2 oil droplets that measure 25-35 x 12-14 microns (Beug).

NAME ORIGIN  means "reddish-brown", from Latin, (Schalkwijk-Barendsen)
SIMILAR  Peziza varia [group] and Peziza vesiculosa are differentiated most clearly by the color of the upper surface (Breitenbach). Peziza phyllogena (as P. badio-confusa Korf) was distinguished from P. badia in 1954 by Korf: speaking of P. badio-confusa Korf, he said, "This species is almost invariably determined in America as Peziza badia [name in italics], and certainly is that figured by Seaver... under this name. It is perhaps our commonest large cup-fungus, and it seems to me that it must have been described before 1897 by some European or American author, but I have seen no types which match it. The true P. badia [name in italics] has reticulate spore-markings, as shown by Le Gal". (Korf(5)). Elliott & Kaufert in 1974 redescribed both of these species microscopically, refining the distinction between the two species: P. phyllogena had spores with "walls finely roughened, with warts about 0.5 microns in height, frequently smooth at ends of mature spores as primary wall remains attached (apiculus)" (with the letter mu used for microns), whereas P. badia had spores "ornamented with short predominantly longitudinal ridges which unite to form an incomplete and irregular reticulum, ridges about 0.5 microns in height, apiculus not seen"; if the fruitbody was found on downed wood rather than on the ground it was much more likely to be P. phyllogena although occasional collections of P. badia are found on wood, P. phyllogena was collected from May 18 to July 26 in Canada and from March 28 to June 25 in the US (excluding AK), [although Ginns examined a September 12 collection from ON and cites a September collection from AK], whereas P. badia was collected from July 18 to October 25 in Canada and from June 21 to October 5 in the US; P. phyllogena was examined from BC, ON, PQ, AK, MA, NY, MD, and PA. (Elliott, M.E.(2)). P. phyllogena was reported from BC, WA, OR, ID, CA, UT, (Larsen as P. badioconfusa). See also SIMILAR section of Peziza limnaea.

ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  We use the term Peziza varia group to cover Peziza varia itself, Peziza 'repanda' collections that are compatible with the description of Peziza varia, and Peziza cerea. We follow Hansen, K.(2) in regarding Peziza cerea as a synonym of Peziza varia, although it is maintained separately in the online Species Fungorum and MycoBank, each accessed February 28, 2018. K. Hansen et al. include Peziza cerea Fr. as a synonym (finding that moniliform paraphyses were a result of moisture and not taxonomically valuable). Features ascribed to Peziza cerea include 1) a fruitbody that is cup-shaped then expanded, the upper surface pale yellowish to saffron or yellowish brown, 2) whitish scurfy-downy exterior, 3) short stem, 4) growth on a variety of specialized substrates, and 5) microscopic characters.^ Peziza cerea is placed in synonymy with P. varia by K. Hansen et al. (2002), who note that P. cerea Bull. is most likely P. vesiculosa. RANGE Peziza cerea is found at least in OR and NV, according to Larsen(1).

NAME ORIGIN  means 'waxy'
SIMILAR  Peziza varia has its paraphyses described differently: they are septate, with the individual cells "sometimes constricted at the septa, that is, arranged in a row to resemble a chain (moniliform), especially in older specimens", and P. varia has a "distinctly layered trama in which the middle layer of longitudinal hyphae appears under the lens as dark lines", (Breitenbach(1)). The two are considered synonymous by Hansen, K.(2) who write "Collections designated as P. cerea, P. repanda, and Peziza micropus do not differ from P. varia enough to be separable as species, macroscopically, microscopically, or molecularly". Dennis describes the colors of the upper surface of P. varia and P. repanda differently: "light grey-brown at first but soon becoming dark greyish-brown" for P. varia, and "light chestnut brown" for P. repanda, (Dennis).

ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  Peziza phyllogena produces large cup-shaped, stalkless fruitbodies that are purple-brown to red-brown to olive-brown on the upper surface, paler and scurfy-granular on the lower surface, growing on soil or decaying wood, with finely warty spores.^ Peziza badioconfusa Korf was listed as a synonym of Peziza phyllogena Cooke in the online Species Fungorum, accessed March 17, 2018, but MycoBank, accessed the same date, listed them separately. Peziza phyllogena (as P. badio-confusa Korf) was distinguished from P. badia in 1954 by Korf: speaking of P. badio-confusa Korf, he said, "This species is almost invariably determined in America as Peziza badia [name in italics], and certainly is that figured by Seaver... under this name. It is perhaps our commonest large cup-fungus, and it seems to me that it must have been described before 1897 by some European or American author, but I have seen no types which match it. The true P. badia [name in italics] has reticulate spore-markings, as shown by Le Gal". (Korf(5)). Elliott & Kaufert in 1974 redescribed both of these species microscopically, refining the distinction between the two species: P. phyllogena had spores with "walls finely roughened, with warts about 0.5 microns in height, frequently smooth at ends of mature spores as primary wall remains attached (apiculus)", whereas P. badia had spores "ornamented with short predominantly longitudinal ridges which unite to form an incomplete and irregular reticulum, ridges about 0.5 microns in height, apiculus not seen" (with the letter mu used for microns); if the fruitbody was found on downed wood rather than on the ground it was much more likely to be P. phyllogena although occasional collections of P. badia are found on wood, P. phyllogena was collected from May 18 to July 26 in Canada and from March 28 to June 25 in the US (excluding AK), [although Ginns examined a September 12 collection from ON and cites a September collection from AK], whereas P. badia was collected from July 18 to October 25 in Canada and from June 21 to October 5 in the US. (Elliott, M.E.(2)). RANGE P. phyllogena was examined from BC, ON, PQ, AK, MA, NY, MD, and PA, (Elliott, M.E.(2)).

NAME ORIGIN  
SIMILAR  Peziza badia is very similar but "its spores have a delicate irregular reticulum versus the finely warted spores" of Peziza phyllogena and its synonym Peziza badioconfusa, (Beug(3)). Peziza kalloi Harmaja has also been confused with P. badioconfusa and occurs at least in northern Europe and AK: it differs from P. badioconfusa in the conspicuous bright violet basal mycelium, shorter (15-19 x 7.5-10 microns) and elliptic spores, spore ornamentation consisting "of warts that vary somewhat in size throughout the spore", being +/- distinctly larger at the spore ends, "the habitat (usually) in moist or wet rich woods and bushes, especially by brooks", mostly in decaying hardwood, the fruiting in summer and fall, and the pronounced boreal distribution, (Harmaja(4)).

The spores of P. violacea are completely smooth. Though P. violacea exists in North America, it is infrequently collected. Most collections under that name are P. praetervisa." The name Peziza praetervisa Bres. in the sense of Dennis is used for this species with lightly ornamented spores, as the sense of Bresadola may correspond to Peziza petersii Berk. & Curt. Because of these difficulties the name Peziza subviolacea Svrcek has been proposed for P. praetervisa Bres. sensu Dennis. In effect, one view (that of Dennis(1), Pfister(5), Breitenbach(1)) uses the name P. praetervisa Bres. for the commoner species in North America that has finely warted mature spores and P. violacea Pers. for the one with smooth mature spores, and the other uses the name Peziza violacea Pers.: Fr. or Peziza subviolacea Svrcek for the commoner species in North America with finely warted spores and Peziza sublilacina Svrcek for the one with smooth spores. We follow Michael Beug in avoiding the name Peziza violacea which is ambiguous. We use the name Peziza praetervisa for the commoner species with finely warted spores and Peziza sublilacina Svrcek for the one with smooth spores. According to Beug(3), P. praetervisa has spores with two oil drops and Peziza sublilacina has spores with no oil drops. RANGE Peziza praetervisa has been found at least in OR, ID, also AB, CO, (according to Larsen(1) who also list P. violacea for British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and Idaho). There are collections under the name Peziza praetervisa Bres. for BC at Pacific Forestry Centre and University of British Columbia. It has been reported from WA by Andrew Parker, pers. comm.

ENGLISH NAMES  recurved cup, brown cup, spreading brown cup fungus
NOTES  We use the term Peziza varia group to cover Peziza varia itself, Peziza cerea (which can be considered a synonym of Peziza varia), and Peziza 'repanda' collections that are compatible with the description of Peziza varia. K. Hansen et al. comment about the use of this species concept, "Since the name lacks a type specimen and has been used inconsistently it is best treated as of uncertain application."^, and this is elaborated as follows: Persoon described the habitat as "in sylvaticis ad terram" [in the woods on the ground]. Fries used the name for a species on old trunks, primarily of Fagus [beech], but also included blackened soil as the substrate - some authors have followed one and some the other, and still others have used the name for a species occurring on soil and only exceptionally on wood, and in all cases the spores are smooth and are in the size range for Peziza varia. The descriptions below are for Peziza repanda Pers. (Seaver, Dennis), Peziza repanda Pers.: Fr. (Hansen), or authority not given (Arora). Many records of P. repanda can be considered Peziza varia. RANGE P. 'repanda' is found at least in BC, WA, OR, ID, and also CA, CO, MT, WY, (Larsen for Peziza repanda Pers. ex Pers.), CA (Arora), NY to IA and MD, also Europe, (Seaver), Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, (Hansen), and United Kingdom (Dennis).
CHEMICAL REACTIONS  
UPPER SURFACE  4-13cm across or occasionally larger, "cup-shaped when young but expanding to nearly flat or often wavy (undulating), the margin often splitting"; spore-bearing upper surface pale brown to medium brown, tan, or when old somewhat darker, "smooth to somewhat wrinkled or convoluted at the center"^, (Arora), reaching 8-10cm across, at first cup-shaped, the margin even or crenate [scalloped], expanding and becoming repand, the margin remaining entire or splitting, regular in outline or irregularly revolute; upper surface concave becoming flat or convex, pale brown, becoming darker when old, (Seaver), occasionally up to 12cm across, "cup-shaped, becoming expanded and undulating"; spore-bearing upper surface light chestnut brown; margin often crenate [scalloped], (Dennis), 1-4cm across, cup-shaped then expanded; upper surface pale brownish, (Hansen)

NAME ORIGIN  means "wavy", "folded" in Latin^, (Schalkwijk-Barendsen)
SIMILAR  The flesh of P. repanda is stratified like that of Peziza varia but the disc is a different shade of brown (P. varia being "light grey-brown at first but soon becoming dark greyish-brown") and the peculiar moniliform paraphyses of P. varia are lacking, (Dennis). Peziza varia and Peziza cerea cannot be differentiated clearly on field characters, (Lincoff(2)). Collections designated as P. cerea, P. repanda, and Peziza micropus do not differ from P. varia enough to be separable as species, macroscopically, microscopically, or molecularly, (Hansen, K.). Dennis also describes the colors of the upper surface of P. cerea differently: "pale ochraceous or yellowish-brown" (Dennis).

NAME ORIGIN  means 'different'
SIMILAR  Peziza cerea has different paraphyses (Breitenbach). Dennis describes the color of P. cerea differently as "pale ochraceous or yellowish brown" on the upper surface, (Dennis). Peziza repanda has slightly less gray color and spores are smooth, (Arora). Peziza repanda and Peziza cerea cannot be differentiated clearly in the field (Lincoff(2)). Collections designated as P. cerea, P. repanda, and Peziza micropus do not differ from P. varia enough to be separable as species, macroscopically, microscopically, or molecularly, (Hansen, K.). Dennis also describes the colors of the upper surface of P. repanda differently, as "light chestnut brown" (Dennis). Peziza fimetii resembles P. varia in color but has larger spores measuring (18)20-22.5 x 10-12 microns "and a medullary excipulum composed of a single textura globulosa layer" with 50-100 microns broad cells, (Medardi).

NAME ORIGIN  named after Orson K. Miller, who collected the type material
SIMILAR  "Plectania milleri differs from P. melastoma in its stellate margin, dark hyphae penetrating the medullary excipulum, and smooth tomentum hyphae. In P. melastoma the margin is entire or slightly split but is never stellate, the tomentum hyphae are encrusted with orange granules, and there are no dark hyphae in the medullary excipulum", (Paden). Pseudoplectania melaena differs in having round spores, and fruiting on dead twigs and branches of conifers in early spring. With immature specimens this species is very similar to round-spored Pseudoplectania nigrella, but at this stage spores may not be obtainable: with mature specimens the larger cup size and stellate margin of P. milleri and the marginal hairs of P. nigrella are sufficient to distinguish them, (Maguire). Plectania nannfeldtii has a long stem, a cup that lacks the toothed edge, an exterior that is less hairy, and spores that are slightly larger, (Trudell). Urnula padeniana and Pseudosarcosoma latahense are more gelatinized.

NOTES  Features include minute grayish, tomentose-powdery, cylindric or cup-shaped fruitbodies crowded together on a grayish mat and microscopic characters including round spores, basidia, gelatinous context, clamp connections, and diverticulate hairs and crystals.^ Some authors call the epithet "poriiforme", based on Article 60.8 of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (2000) which appears to suggest that the compound should be corrected, but Thorn(4) provides the rationale that Article 60G.1(b) allows the compounding form "ae" to indicate the origin of the name, being a reference to the genus Poria rather than porus. Resupinatus poriaeformis has been recorded from BC, also AL, MD, MN, NC, NJ, SC, France, Germany, Sweden, New Zealand, according to Redhead who notes concerning the BC record, "Cooke (1957) has recorded this species from British Columbia.

SIMILAR  Roseodiscus rhodoleucus and Roseodiscus equisetinus grow on dead Equisetum and should be watched for in the Pacific Northwest. The spores of the former measure 9-12 x 5-6 and are non-septate (Dennis(1)). The spores of the latter measure 8-13 x 2.5-3 microns and are 1-septate at maturity (Dennis(1)). There is a collection from WA deposited as Hymenoscyphus rhodoleucus at the University of Washington. At least one species of small pink discomycete occurs on dead Equisetum in British Columbia, but Stamnaria is another genus that may produce pink fruitbodies on dead Equisetum (collection listed as Stamnaria persoonii at the University of British Columbia, although spores were measured at (14)15-18 x 4-5 microns, narrower than some measurements such as 15-18 x 5-8 in Dennis(1)). Psilachnum inquilinum  (P. Karst.) Dennis was identified by Haines(1) with seven collections examined from Washington on Equisetum during the course of his Master's thesis. These are not pink but white to cream-colored. He says the sessile to short-stemmed cups are up to 0.1(0.15)cm across, the exterior "sparsely covered with hairs which appear white under the dissecting scope, disc often slightly darker than the exterior", the spores 7-8 x 2-2.5 microns, clavate-cylindric, the paraphyses narrowly filiform-lanceolate, up to 2 microns wide, exceeding asci by no more than 8 microns; the hairs 3-4.5 microns wide and up to 50 microns long, colorless, smooth, thin-walled, irregularly cylindric, septate, slightly constricted at the septa, cells 10-15 microns long.

He says it is up to 0.1cm across, up to 0.15cm high, white with a slight reddish tinge, covered by hairs when dry. The stem is up to 0.1cm x 0.02cm. Spores measuring 30-40 x 1.5 microns are colorless, 1-septate or more, filled with refractive droplets, 6-8 spores parallel in an ascus that measures 50-65 x 5-7 microns. Paraphyses are lanceolate, colorless, usually without refractive droplets, up to 20 microns longer than asci, 2.5-3 microns at widest point. Colorless hairs are 2.5-3 microns wide, up to 100 microns long, 0-2-septate, and densely covered with minute granules. The excipulum is composed of colorless, relatively thin-walled prismatic cells measuring approximately 12 x 8 microns. It is also described on dead Juncus in Dennis(1) as very common in Britain.

SIMILAR  There are many other Stictis species beyond those described here, some of which probably occur in the Pacific Northwest. Several have been recorded from CA and another from MT in the Sherwood(2) monograph. Stictis stellata, a similar widespread common species examined from Europe, New Jersey, Ohio, Louisiana, Mexico, and South America, grows on herbaceous plants (occasionally wood), but compared with S. radiata it has wider unbranched periphysoids (the only reliable differentiation, 1.5-2.0 microns wide), narrower spores (but overlapping at 1.5-2.5 microns wide), and a hymenium that does not turn blue in iodine (but S. radiata can be iodine negative), (Sherwood). Sphaerobolus stellatus has empty receptacles that are somewhat reminiscent - Sphaerobolus rosaceus and Sphaerobolus corii are actually two of the synonyms of S. radiata listed in Sherwood(2).

SIMILAR  Pseudosarcosoma latahense is smaller (2-7.5cm across), purple-brown to black, grows particularly at high elevations, and spores lack oil droplets at maturity, (Arora). P. latahense has usually smaller fruitbodies, has spores that lack oil droplets, and has tomentum hyphae that are smooth except for occasional dark granules and usually light in color, (Paden). P. latahense is smaller (up to about 4cm instead of up to 10cm), "less gelatinous, with the gelatin diminishing greatly as the fruitbodies age", the cups "with a gray, rather than black, exterior", and has spores 24-37 x 9-12 microns and lacking oil droplets at maturity, (Trudell). Sarcosoma globosum (jelly pots) has been reported from "In the rain forests of Sugarbowl-Grizzly Den Provincial Park, British Columbia" by Curtis Randall Bjork who posted a video on Facebook seen June 25, 2017. He wrote "This ascomycete has a more or less spherical stalk that is filled with a liquid gel. The spore-bearing part is the disc on top. This species is rare in Europe." In the comments about this posting, Andy McKinnon noted, " I've seen this species once before, about three decades ago, just outside Prince George [BC]. It's distinctive and remarkable." The appearance in the video does not closely resemble other photos that depict a hymenium located in a depression on the upper part of the fruitbody. In the video some of the fruitbodies have developed an everted disc. In addition to its occurrence in Europe, Sarcosoma globosum (the same as Bulgaria globosa but not Sarcoleotia globosa) is said to be rare in northeastern North America.

STEM  up to 1.5cm long, 0.1-0.2cm wide, white to bluish-gray, or brownish, rather darker in lower part; minutely squamulose [finely scaly]^, (Seaver), 0.1-0.2cm wide, round in cross-section; white; minutely tomentose, frequently matted and appearing smooth, (Mains), stem tapering downwards, pubescent with short, downy, blackish hairs, (Dennis), 0.2-0.4cm wide, cylindric; white, gray-whitish to brown-blackish; sometimes slightly downy and dark-scaled toward the base (blackish hairs), (Breitenbach)
ODOR  
TASTE  
EDIBILITY  
HABITAT  single, gregarious, or in clusters of 2 or 3 each, on wholly or partly submerged sticks etc., in brooks, mostly at higher altitudes^, (Seaver), gregarious, cespitose [in tufts] or scattered, on decaying wood, leaves etc. in cold wet places, often in streams, (Mains), the ascospores, when mature, project and vibrate in the running water above the fertile area giving the fruiting body a white silky appearance, (Tylutki), gregarious on wood and remains of roots that are very wet or under water, in ditches among Sphagnum, or in small streams, commonly montane to alpine, (Breitenbach for Europe)
SPORE DEPOSIT  
MICROSCOPIC  spores up to 250 microns x 1 microns, slenderly filiform [thread-like], slightly narrowed toward each end, nearly as long as ascus, in a parallel fascicle in the ascus, multiseptate^; asci 8-spored, up to 200-325 microns long and 5-6 microns wide, slender-cylindric, apex rounded, not blue with iodine; paraphyses thread-like, occasionally forked, the apices somewhat clavate-thickened and colored, (Seaver), ascospores very variable in length, (80)125-250(275) x 1 micron, filiform [thread-like], multiseptate; asci variable in length, 175-325 x 5-6 microns, narrowly clavate, gradually narrowing from near the apex; paraphyses straight, simple or branched, filiform in lower part, enlarged at apices, (Mains), spores 185-190 x 1.5 microns, filiform, colorless, smooth, multiply septate; asci 8-spored, 200-250 x 6-9 microns; paraphyses filiform, forked and slightly clavate toward tips, septate, (Breitenbach)

LATIN NAMES  Wynnella silvicola  (Beck) Nannf.^  Ann. Bot. Fenn. 3: 309. 1966;  == Helvella silvicola  (Beck ex Sacc.) Harmaja;  == Otidea silvicola  Beck
ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  {See also Otidea Table.} Features include an Otidea-like fruiting body [like a vertically elongated cup with an opening down the side], dark purplish red brown to dark brown color on the inside surface and medium red brown exterior, short stem, growth in duff under conifers, and microscopic characters.^ The description is derived from Abbott(1). RANGE Wynnella silvicola is found at least in BC, AB, MB, PQ, YT, MT, and Romania, and is reported from eastern North America, Europe, and Asia, (Abbott). It is also found in WA and ID, (Larsen). A collection from OR was used by O'Donnell(2).
CHEMICAL REACTIONS  
UPPER SURFACE  0.5-2.3cm in diameter, 1-6cm high (up to 5cm x 8cm fresh), ear-shaped or rarely irregularly cup-shaped with one enlarged lobe, margin inrolled at first, expanding and rarely somewhat reflexed when old; dark purplish red brown to dark brown when fresh, blackish brown when dry; smooth or rarely slightly wavy-wrinkled when very old^, (Abbott)
FLESH  
UNDERSIDE  medium red brown or pale red brown to white near base; bald^, (Abbott)
STEM  0.2-1cm x 0.2-0.9cm (up to 0.8cm x 2cm fresh), narrowing to base or nearly equal; "yellow brown to pale yellow or white at base"; "shallowly fluted or ribbed", sulcate [grooved] and solid or with central chamber^, (Abbott)
ODOR  unique strong odor when dried, but not detected fresh^, (Abbott)
TASTE  
EDIBILITY  
HABITAT  "solitary to gregarious or scattered and numerous on duff, rarely in burned areas, under conifers", June to September^, (Abbott)
SPORE DEPOSIT  
MICROSCOPIC  spores 17-24 x 11.5-17 microns, broadly elliptic, smooth, colorless, with one droplet^; asci 200 x 15-19 microns; paraphyses clavate, 5-6 microns wide at apex, brown, contents finely granular, (Abbott), spores 22-25 microns long (Arora)
NAME ORIGIN  means 'living in the forest'
SIMILAR  Otidea smithii can be somewhat similar but has smaller spores with two large droplets.
