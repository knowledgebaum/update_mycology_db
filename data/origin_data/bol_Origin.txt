NOTES  Features include 1) whitish to grayish buff smooth cap with suede-like texture, 2) thick unchanging whitish flesh, 3) pores that are whitish when young and do not become blue when bruised, 4) whitish to buff stem that is reticulate at least on the upper part, and 5) mild taste.^ Trudell(4) comment, "Generally considered to occur only in the Southwest, there have been sporadic reports of it occurring in places such as Idaho and southern California, under trees other than ponderosa pine. In Seattle, a very similar mushroom is fairly common in late spring under oaks and species of Tilia [italicized], such as lindens and basswood. Although it was felt that this had to be a different species, preliminary DNA analysis suggests it is very close to B. barrowsii.". RANGE If both close taxa are included, B. barrowsii found at least in ID, CA, AZ, NM, CO, and Mexico, (Bessette). The University of Washington has collections from WA and NM.

NAME ORIGIN  after Lillian Mott
SIMILAR  Boletus mottiae is distinguished from members of Boletus edulis complex by the strongly reticulated or ridged surface of the cap of B. mottiae. When compared with B. edulis, cap color is different, and reticulum on stem is of B. mottiae is much more delicate, (Thiers). Boletus fibrillosus (cap surface remotely suggestive of that of B. mottiae) has yellow tubes when young, a rather elongated stem, and a much darker colored cap, (Thiers).

ENGLISH NAMES  spring king bolete, spring king
NOTES  Features include a dry reddish brown cap, when young with a fine white bloom, white unstaining flesh, pores that are whitish at first becoming yellow or yellowish buff and finally greenish, the pores sometimes becoming cinnamon brown near cap margin, dry white-reticulate club-shaped stem that is white when young, often developing brownish tinges when old, and spring growth in the mountains.^ The description is derived from Arora(2). This species has been referred to as Boletus pinophilus Pilat & Dermek and as its synonym Boletus pinicola (Vittad.) A. Venturi, but that European species is considered by some authors to be somewhat different. Bessette(3) describes as "widely distributed throughout North America" a taxon under the name Boletus pinophilus Pilat & Dermek (with spores given as 15-20 x 4-6 microns). Arora(2) say that the spores of B. rex-veris are slightly narrower than those of the European Boletus pinophilus, but Snell(6) found that spores of dried collections of Boletus edulis subsp. pinicola sent to them from California, Montana, Wyoming and Colorado were somewhat wider and longer (otherwise fitting the European descriptions). Whereas the European descriptions gave the spores as 14-17 x 4.5-5.5 microns, 13-17.5 x 4.5-6 microns etc., they found the spores of the specimens on the whole slightly larger: 14-21 x 5-6 microns, with a few 7 microns wide, mostly 16-18 x 5.5-6 microns, with a tendency for the majority to vary in length directly with the size of the specimens. (Snell(6)). Nevertheless, sequencing of a Washington "spring king" indicated that it was Boletus rex-veris (M. Beug, pers. comm.). RANGE Collections were examined from CA and OR by Arora(2). In CA it is locally abundant in the mountains, fruiting in April-June at mid-elevations (3000-4000 feet) and into July at higher elevations (up to 7000 feet), occurring at somewhat lower elevations in Cascades of OR and WA, extending east through the Blue Mountains to ID and perhaps beyond, and north to BC, outside of California also fruiting principally in spring or early summer, (Arora(2)).

The descriptions is derived from Arora(3). RANGE Butyriboletus autumniregius collections were examined from CA and OR.
CHEMICAL REACTIONS  
CAP  8-30cm across, convex becoming broadly convex when mature or sometimes flat; "wholly or mostly rose red to vinaceous red or at times mottled with tan or yellow"; dry or slightly tacky but not viscid, bald or "breaking up to form many small scales" (the scales typically smaller than in Butyriboletus abieticola)
FLESH  firm, dense, thick; "pale yellow, typically unchanging in the button stage but in age usually turning blue at least somewhat when cut (often slowly and erratically)"; in stem, "firm, pale yellow except for the base, which usually has a distinct vinaceous tinge, turning blue slightly or not at all when cut"
PORES  typically less than 1 millimeter wide, pore surface usually the same color as the tubes which are "pale yellow becoming bright yellow and eventually olive yellow or greenish", pore surface "typically turning blue quickly when bruised except in the button stage"; tubes at first short in relation to the cap flesh but 1-2.5cm or longer when mature

NAME ORIGIN  "autumni" refers to autumn fruiting, and "regius" means "kingly" and also refers to the European Butyriboletus regius
SIMILAR  Butyriboletus primiregius is best distinguished by fruiting in the spring. The cap has a pronounced tendency, lacking in B. autumniregius, to fade to dingy olive brown or paler when it is exposed to sunlight, but this could be environmental. Butyriboletus querciregius 1) grows with oak, 2) has shorter spores and a smaller length to width ratio (3.0), and 3) has a less vivid cap color (pinkish red, pinkish brown, or yellowish when fresh as opposed to tending toward deep rose red or vinaceous red when fresh). The cap color of the cap of B. querciregius is also referred to as "red or dull red or even orange-red, sometimes blotched with yellow before fading to pinkish brown, tan or yellowish". Butyriboletus regius, known from Europe turns blue only rarely when cut. Butyriboletus abieticola has fibrillose scales when mature. (Arora(3)).

SIMILAR  Butyriboletus autumniregius fruits in fall, and the cap does not tend to fade as much (which could be due to environment) (Arora(3)). Butyriboletus querciregius 1) grows with oak, 2) has shorter spores and a smaller length to width ratio (3.0), and 3) has the cap color described differently (pinkish red, pinkish brown, or yellowish when fresh). The cap color of the cap of B. querciregius is also referred to as "red or dull red or even orange-red, sometimes blotched with yellow before fading to pinkish brown, tan or yellowish". (Arora(3)). Butyriboletus regius, known from Europe turns blue only rarely when cut (Arora(3)). Butyriboletus abieticola has fibrillose scales when mature (Arora(3)).

NOTES  Butyriboletus regius group is distinguished by its pink to reddish cap, yellow pores which in the Pacific Northwest stain blue, yellow flesh, and large thick reticulate stem, (Arora 1986).^ The true Butyriboletus regius is known from Europe. Its relatives in western North America have been redescribed as Butyriboletus querciregius, Butyriboletus primiregius, and Butyriboletus autumniregius (see separate entries). These species are separated (though not markedly) by molecular methods, and differ also in habitat, fruiting season, the extent of pinkish to vinaceous coloring, the presence of fibrillose scales on cap, and subtle differences in spore size.

ENGLISH NAMES  bitter bolete
NOTES  The Pacific Northwest status of boletes resembling Caloboletus calopus is not clear. Features of Caloboletus calopus include brown cap, yellow pores, a reticulated stem that is yellow to red, flesh and pores that turn rapidly blue when damaged, and bitter taste. Caloboletus frustosus [also known as Boletus calopus var. frustosus and as Boletus frustosus Snell & E.A. Dick and Caloboletus frustosus (Snell & E.A. Dick) D. Arora & J.L. Frank] is said by Bessette(3) to have "a conspicuously rimose-areolate to fissured yellowish brown to grayish brown pileus at maturity" which Boletus calopus var. calopus is "almost identical but has a nearly smooth pileus that does not become conspicuously rimose-areolate to fissured at maturity". The Bessette(3) description of the cap context says "unchanging when exposed" for var. frustosus and "rapidly staining when cut" for var. calopus, and the spore measurements given are different as well. But according to Siegel(2), based on preliminary genetic analysis, it is possible that Caloboletus frustosus is the same species as Caloboletus conifericola - if so the name Caloboletus frustosus would take precedence.^ RANGE Caloboletus calopus var. calopus is said to be fairly common in the Pacific Northwest, and also occurs in MI, NH, and NY, (Bessette as Boletus calopus var. calopus). There are collections at the University of Washington labeled as Boletus calopus (variety not specified) from Washington and Oregon, and also to occur at the University of British Columbia from British Columbia. Caloboletus frustosus is said to be fairly common from the Rocky Mountains of Idaho west to Washington and south to California, (Bessette as Boletus calopus var. frustosus). There is also a 1942 collection from Oregon as Boletus frustosus at the University of Washington.

NOTES  Features include 1) a brick-red cap, 2) flesh that turns reddish before becoming bluish black, and 3) the development of pigment globules in cells of the cap cuticle hyphae in Melzer's reagent. This name was formerly applied to several similar species, and its presence in North America is disputed.^ See Kuo(5) (accessed July 10, 2013) under "Leccinum: Uncertain Taxa" for a more detailed discussion. Trudell(4) comment in relation to the Pacific Northwest (Latin names italicized) "A large, often abundant species that has been called Leccinum aurantiacum occurs in our conifer forests. That name, however, is incorrect since L. aurantiacum has been shown to be associated with hardwoods. Our species may be closer to L. vulpinum described from Europe.".

SIMILAR  Leccinum discolor has duller cap colors (dull orange brown to dull cinnamon), and lacks orange-brown pigment globules in the cap cuticle hyphae when revived in Melzer's reagent, (Bessette). Leccinum insigne has flesh that stains bluish gray to blackish without an intervening reddish or pinkish phase, and grows under birch as well as aspen, (Bessette). L. insigne is ornamented by maturity with black scabers, but Leccinum aurantiacum may not reach this state till old age; hyphae of the cap cuticle of L. aurantiacum are relatively smooth in contrast to those of L. insigne, (Smith(35)). Leccinum idahoense has a dark liver-brown granulose-areolate cap, is very slow change to gray when the flesh is cut, and has a relatively pale cinnamon spore deposit, (Smith(37)).

ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  Also listed in Gilled category. Features include olive to olive-fuscous cap, pallid to yellowish flesh without blue-staining, adnexed-seceding bright yellow gills, stem with dull yellow ground color (bright yellow near base), overlaid with brown to reddish pruina, growth on sand dunes, and elongated spores.^ A.H. Smith and J.M. Trappe lists the outstanding features in the original description as "the immediate NH4OH reaction to violet-fuscous of the cuticle of the pileus when fresh, the olive to olive-fuscous color of the pileus, the lack of any blue stain when the hymenophore or context are injured, the adnexed to emarginate-seceding lamellae, and the bright yellow base of the stipe". They go on to say that the common Phylloporus rhodoxanthus "is readily distinguished by a number of characters such as the gills being decurrent, by the ammonia reaction, and the dull red to bay colored pileus". (Smith(10)). Nevertheless, there are observers who say that many collections otherwise fitting Phylloporus arenicola do stain blue, and DNA sequences thus far in California and the Pacific Northwest match Phylloporus arenicola. RANGE Phylloporus arenicola is found at least in OR, (Smith), also CA (Bessette), and WA (vouchered at University of Washington).

ENGLISH NAMES  gilled bolete
NOTES  Also listed in Gilled category. Most or all of the observations of this species on the west coast of North America are Phylloporus arenicola. Features are dry minutely velvety brown to reddish cap that looks like a Boletus, and thick yellow gills.^ The subspecies is not specified for the Arora description below (note that he says the gills typically bruise green or blue but sometimes not at all), but Bessette's description is for ssp. americanus Singer (without that color change). Ssp. foliiporus (Murrill) Singer has a bright yellow gill-like surface that stains bluish to greenish when bruised and a cinnamon to dark pinkish brown cap and according to Both(1) is recorded from Florida north to New Jersey. (Incidentally Both(1) says that the photo in Phillips(1) p. 127 of P. foliiporus is P. boletinoides). P. rhodoxanthus ssp. albomycelinus Snell and Dick from eastern North America (with white basal mycelium) has been renamed P. leucomycelinus Singer. RANGE P. rhodoxanthus is reported from WA by O'Dell, and is not uncommon on foray lists in BC (often blue-staining), with collections at the Pacific Forestry Centre and the University of British Columbia, and there are collections from WA at the University of Washington. Bessette gives range of ssp. americanus as eastern Canada south to FL, west to CA.

ENGLISH NAMES  dark bolete, dusky bolete
NOTES  Features include 1) a dry, velvety cap that is dark brown to olive-brown or dark vinaceous brown, 2) white flesh that turns blue then reddish brown when exposed, 3) pores that are brown when young, 4) tubes that become blue when bruised or exposed, and 5) cap-colored stem that may be reticulate.^ Not all authors accept the synonymy used here. Differing species concepts may be involved as Singer (according to Bessette et al.) described Tylopilus porphyrosporus as a medium to large bolete growing at lower elevations in hardwood forests and mixed woods and having flesh that stains blue when exposed, and Tylopilus pseudoscaber as a small to medium bolete that grows at higher elevations in conifer woods and with flesh that does not stain blue when exposed (but in another source states slight blueing has occasionally been observed in T. pseudoscaber), (Bessette). Smith(35) on the other hand distinguishes T. porphyrosporus with pores pallid to grayish when young and flesh slowly becoming fuscous when cut from T. pseudoscaber with pores coffee brown when young and flesh staining blue then reddish when cut (while noting that the Fries species concept Boletus porphyrosporus that they are using does have flesh that turns blue). Tylopilus pacificus was originally described from Washington and is often regarded as a synonym too. Tylopilus olivaceobrunneus was originally described from Oregon (see under SIMILAR for different ideas about its status). By 2018 an attempt was being made to study these similar taxa and determine the status of entities on the west coast of North America. RANGE Porphyrellus porphyrosporus is found from eastern North America to the Pacific Northwest (Bessette), including MI (Smith(35), who is describing Pacific Northwest material), CA (Thiers, Phillips), and NS (Grund). It is found in WA (Trudell(1)). There are Paul Kroeger collections from BC labeled Tylopilus pseudoscaber at the University of British Columbia.

ENGLISH NAMES  Alice Eastwood's Boletus
NOTES  {See also Red-pored Boletus Table.} Rubroboletus eastwoodiae is recognized by red pores, light gray to olive-buff cap with pink flushes, and abruptly bulbous reticulate stem.^ This taxon has been known as Boletus satanas Lenz in California and the Pacific Northwest. Thiers and Halling in 1976 examined the type of Boletus eastwoodiae (Murrill) Sacc. & Trotter and found it to be Boletus satanas: what had passed in California under the name Boletus eastwoodiae was renamed Boletus pulcherrimus Thiers and Halling, (Both(1)). However, European material of Boletus satanas has a different coloration of the cap and lacks the abruptly bulbous base (the separation of the two should be established by molecular methods). To summarize the confusing issue, Boletus eastwoodiae was the name for what used to be called Boletus satanas, and Boletus pulcherrimus the name for what used to be called Boletus eastwoodiae! Boletus eastwoodiae then became Rubroboletus eastwoodiae and Boletus pulcherrimus became Rubroboletus pulcherrimus. The proposed new name, Rubroboletus eastwoodiae was considered in a nomenclatural comment in the online Species Fungorum, accessed June 20, 2015 to be Nom. inval., Art. 40.1 (Melbourne) [because the type of the name is not indicated]. RANGE This taxon is found in CA (Bessette), rare in OR (vouchered at Oregon State University), and rare in WA (recorded by Michael Beug, pers. comm.).

NAME ORIGIN  Rubroboletus eastwoodiae is named after the collector of the type, Miss Alice Eastwood. Incidentally the name Boletus satanas is after Satan, the ecclesiastical Latin name for whom is "Satanas". Some authors including Alexander Smith and the Millers call that species Boletus satanus but this usage is hard to defend. The ecclesiastical Latin for "Satan" is "Satanas" and Lenz presumably used this noun as the species name - there is no reason to correct it to "satanus".
SIMILAR  Rubroboletus pulcherrimus has a dark reddish brown cap, dark red (as opposed to paler and more vinaceous red) pores, and the stem is clavate or bulbous (as opposed to typically abruptly bulbous) with dark red reticulations, it is found in coniferous and mixed woods (not with oak), and microscopically the spores are larger, none of the septa of the tramal hyphae are amyloid, and the hyphae of the cap cuticle have noticeably roughened walls, (Thiers(1) comparing B. satanas to what was then generally known as B. eastwoodiae and which he and Halling later renamed B. pulcherrimus). Rubroboletus haematinus lacks the abrupt bulbous stem, has no gray color on cap or pink tones on stem, and grows with conifers. Microscopically, none of the septa of the cap trama are amyloid, and spores are larger.

SIMILAR  Rubroboletus pulcherrimus has a dark red pore surface that becomes orange-red, then brownish red when old, and a dull red to pale reddish brown reticulate stem, (Bessette). Rubroboletus eastwoodiae has a grayish cap with pink tones and a massive abruptly bulbous stem, (Bessette using the name Boletus satanas). Rubroboletus haematinus differs from R. pulcherrimus in the shape and color of the stem, the yellow color of the pores when young, the absence of reddish brown coloration in the cap, and the mycorrhizal associate, (Thiers). R. haematinus is distinguished from Rubroboletus eastwoodiae by the different mycorrhizal associate, the absence of an exaggerated bulbous stem, the absence of gray color on the cap or pink color tones on the stem, larger spores, and septa on hyphae of cap trama that are not amyloid, (Thiers).

NOTES  Features include 1) an olive-brown to yellow-brown, glutinous cap that appears streaked-fibrillose below the gluten and typically has hanging veil remnants on the margin, 2) whitish to pale yellow flesh that is unchanging or stains dingy pinkish, 3) olive-grayish-buff to yellowish pores that are often beaded with droplets, 4) whitish to yellowish stem, 5) a large band-like annulus on stem, and 6) conspicuous glandular dots on stem that become blackish when old.^ Regarding the synonymy of Suillus subolivaceus with Suillus acidus, Nguyen(3) wrote, "The /acidus clade contained sequences from the holotypes of S. lutescens A.H. Sm. & Thiers and S. subolivaceus A.H. Sm. & Thiers. We were unable to obtain a sequence for the type of S. acidus (Peck) Singer, but all specimens of what we identified as S. acidus based on morphology fit into this clade. (Smith and Thiers 1964a) thought that S. lutescens was closely related to S. acidus, and our sequence data support that relationship. To confirm the correct name for this clade, the holotype sequences for S. acidus will need to be obtained. Given the age of the holotype (before 1905), epitypification may be the best approach." When accessed on February 18, 2018, the online Species Fungorum gave the current name as Suillus acidus, and MycoBank gave Suillus subolivaceus as separate or a variety of Suillus acidus. Suillus acidus is rather common in WA and OR, (Smith(34) as S. subolivaceus).

NOTES  Features include 1) a viscid, yellow cap with reddish to brown spots, streaks, or plaques, 2) yellow or olive-yellow flesh that turns cinnamon brown to vinaceous when cut, 3) large angular pores that stain vinaceous brown to dull cinnamon when bruised, 4) a yellowish stem that is often crooked and becomes hollow, that has reddish brown to cinnamon or dark brown glandular dots and smears, and that stains vinaceous to brown when handled, and 5) a veil that leaves remnants hanging from the cap margin and occasionally forms a slight annulus.^ |The molecular study of Nguyen(3) provides support for the synonymy of Suillus sibiricus with Suillus americanus, although they did not have holotype sequences apart from Suillus himalayensis. They refer also to support for the concept from Klofac W. 2013. A world-wide key to the genus Suillus. Osterr Z Pilzkd 22:211278. Nguyen(3) mention that americanus and sibiricus could still represent different forms. [Klofac recognized Suillus americanus f. sibiricus and Suillus americanus f. helveticus in 2013]. Partly for that reason, North American descriptions of Suillus sibiricus are included for the present below and marked as such. |When talking of Suillus sibiricus, Bessette(3) said that Suillus americanus has a brighter yellow cap with reddish to cinnamon patches and a thinner stem that is typically less than 1cm, and does not have an annulus, Thiers(1) said S. americanus does not stain vinaceous in the stem base, and (Smith(34)) says that S. americanus has a thinner stem that is never hollowed out, and veil material seldom if ever occurs on the stem. |The online Species Fungorum, accessed December 4, 2017 gives the current name of Suillus sibiricus (Singer) Singer as Suillus americanus (Peck) Snell. MycoBank, accessed the same day, maintained them separately. |RANGE There are collections identified as S. americanus at University of Washington for WA and at Oregon State University for OR, including one at the latter identified for the Oregon coast by A.H.

NAME ORIGIN  means "American"
SIMILAR  Suillus sibiricus has a thicker stem and some fruitbodies in a group generally have an annulus, (Smith(35)). S. sibiricus has flesh in the stem base that stains vinaceous, (Thiers: by listing this as the most obvious and constant difference, he implies that this is not the case in S. americanus). Suillus flavidus generally has larger pores, has a somewhat smaller, more umbonate cap that is often pallid in color, and is associated with Lodgepole Pine rather than five-needle pine, (Thiers for S. sibiricus). S. flavidus is also described as bald (although Thiers describes reddish brown or concolorous plaques or spots as often on margin) and having a well developed gelatinous annulus. Suillus americanus in eastern North America (reported from the Southwest with a few records from Pacific Northwest), has a brighter yellow cap with reddish to cinnamon patches and a thinner stem that is typically less than 1cm, and does not have an annulus, (Bessette for S. sibiricus). S. americanus does not stain vinaceous in the stem base, (Thiers). S. americanus has a thinner stem that is never hollowed out, and veil material seldom if ever occurs on the stem, (Smith(34) for S. sibiricus). See also SIMILAR section of Suillus acidus.

NOTES  Suillus flavidus is recognized in North America by 1) a tan to yellowish to olive-brown, umbonate, viscid to glutinous cap, 2) pale yellow flesh that stains dingy cinnamon, 3) irregular pores that are often compound and often radially arranged, and are yellowish to olive yellow bruising dingy pinkish cinnamon, 4) a slim, whitish to pale yellow stem with glandular dots, 5) viscid annulus, and 6) growth under pines.^ |Authors have debated for many years whether Suillus umbonatus, described from Utah, is a synonym of Suillus flavidus of Europe. Here is the opinion of Nguyen(3) published in 2016, based on their molecular studies (with Latin names italicized), "The /flavidus clade contained specimens with names such as S. umbonatus E.A. Dick & Snell, S. megaporinus Snell & E.A. Dick, S. flavidus (Fr.: Fr.) J. Presl, and S. helenae. Members of this clade exhibit the largest diameter of pores in the genus (up to 1cm). The name S. flavidus has been used for European specimens, whereas the name S. umbonatus is applied to the western North American specimens, and S. megaporinus is applied only to specimens collected in the Sierra Nevada of California. The holotype sequence of S. helenae (named for Helen Smith, Alexander Smiths wife) also fits within the group and was described from a single collection in Oregon. If holotypes of the aforementioned species fit in this clade, S. flavidus is the oldest name and should be used for this species." |They do include collections of Suillus umbonatus from CO, CO, and CA. There are three other collections named in the phylogenetic tree as S. umbonatus - presumably they would have occasioned comment if they had not been North American. |The online Index Species, and MycoBank, accessed February 18, 2018, both maintained them as separate entries, but this is just a reflection of the fact that the holotype of Suillus umbonatus has not been sequenced. |The balance of the evidence is that what we have been identifying in the Pacific Northwest as Suillus umbonatus should now be called Suillus flavidus (Pacific Northwest material does fit the description of Suillus umbonatus.) |On the subject of Suillus helenae, the molecular work of Nguyen(3) shows that the holotype of Suillus helenae from OR falls within the clade that included Suillus flavidus and Suillus umbonatus, which would indicate synonymy of Suillus helenae with Suillus flavidus under the latter name. Suillus helenae has been differentiated by lacking the partial veil and annulus of Suillus flavidus (Thiers(12) original description, Arora(1), Bessette(3)). Thiers(12) say (with Latin names italicized), "It has the stature and large pores characteristic of Suillus umbonatus Dick & Snell or S. flavidus (Fr.) Singer but both of these species have a veil and no such structure was present on any of the basidiocarps of this collection. The cuticular structure of S. helenae is also distinct in that there is no apparent gelatinization of the hyphae in KOH and, furthermore, these hyphae are relatively large and appear incrusted. The discovery of this species marks the first example apparently representing an evolutionary line branching from the S. umbonatus-S. flavidus complex." |RANGE S. flavidus has been found in WA, OR, ID, CA, and UT, (Smith), and was reported from BC (in Redhead). Suillus umbonatus also occurs in CA (Thiers(1), Arora(1)). Nguyen(3) include collections from CO and CA at least.

NOTES  There is not yet clear evidence that either European Suillus granulatus or eastern North American Suillus 'granulatus' (which needs a new name) occurs in the Pacific Northwest, although identifications have been made (see RANGE). Features of North American Suillus 'granulatus' include 1) viscid to glutinous cap that is whitish, tan, brown, cinnamon, or orange-cinnamon, 2) whitish to yellowish pores that stain dull cinnamon, 3) whitish to pale yellow flesh that does not turn blue, 4) whitish to yellowish stem with conspicuous pinkish tan to brown dots, 5) absent veil, and 6) growth under pine.^ North American Suillus 'granulatus' (which associates with soft pines) is not genetically close to European Suillus granulatus (which associates with hard pines) in the work of Nguyen(3). The latter paper proposed in 2006 the use of the name Suillus weaverae for North American Suillus 'granulatus'. However the situation does not appear completely resolved because 1) the Suillus weaverae clade is nested within the Suillus placidus/subalpinus/anomalus complex in Nguyen(3), and 2) The online Species Fungorum, accessed February 24, 2018, gives the current name of Suillus weaverae as Fuscoboletus weaverae. The three other Fuscoboletinus species in the online Species Fungorum, F. spectabilis, F. glandulosus, and F. grisellus, are located in two other parts of the Nguyen(3) tree - note that MycoBank (accessed the same day) gives the Suillus names of these three as obligate synonyms and does not designate a current name. Incidentally, both the online Index Fungorum and MycoBank on that day gave two competing 1996 authorities for Suillus weaverae. Cloudy droplets often cling to the pores of Suillus 'granulatus', giving it the name "milk bolete", (Schalkwijk-Barendsen). RANGE S. 'granulatus' is found in eastern Canada south to SC, west to CA and the Pacific Northwest, (Bessette). It was collected from ID (Smith(36) who discuss the similarity to Suillus punctatipes about which they comment "It is, to all practical purposes, a S. granulatus with a boletinoid configuration of the tube mouths." [Latin name italicized]). For the Smith(36) study they studied 3 collections of S. punctatipes and 10 collections of S. granulatus.

SIMILAR  Suillus brevipes has a glutinous reddish brown cap and short stem that lacks glandular dots or has sparse glandular dots when old, (Bessette). Suillus punctatipes is larger and thicker-stemmed with larger pores and a somewhat different range of cap color (orange-brown to dark brown, dingy tan, pinkish brown, gray, vinaceous gray, or purple-tinged), (Arora). Suillus neoalbidipes has a distinct band of cottony tissue on the margin of young caps, small clusters of caulocystidia, and rare to few clusters of pleurocystidia, whereas S. granulatus has a bald cap margin rarely with a minute tomentum on the immature cap margin, large clusters of caulocystidia, and numerous clusters of pleurocystidia, (Palm).

NAME ORIGIN  after American mycologist E.R. Lake^ (Schalkwijk-Barendsen)
SIMILAR  Suillus caerulescens has flesh in the stem base that stains blue-green more strongly, even in mature specimens, and cap is smoother and stickier, (Bessette). Suillus ponderosus can be difficult to distinguish if annulus is obliterated (colors overlap), but it is massive, with the cap practically bald and noticeably viscid, whereas Suillus lakei is not always strongly viscid and cap is scaly until older, (Smith). Suillus imitatus is bald, and has slightly wider spores, (Smith). The holotype of Suillus flavogranulatus A.H. Sm., Thiers, and O.K. Mill. Lloydia 28: 127-128. 1965 nests within Suillus lakei in the molecular study of Nguyen(3) so that its status as a species is questionable, despite the descriptions in Smith(36) and Bessette(3). The cap of Suillus flavogranulatus was abundant in one Idaho locality in 1964: the cap was described as bald, the cap color pallid becoming pale yellow to pale ochraceous, and the stem as "white, slowly becoming yellow and with numerous pinkish brown glandular dots" over the upper two thirds, the stem base slowly pinkish brown when cut, (Smith(36) who first thought it was a color variation of Suillus granulatus with abnormally large tube mouths). See also SIMILAR section of Suillus ampliporus and Suillus imitatus var. imitatus.

SIMILAR  Suillus pseudobrevipes lacks glandular dots, and has broader hyphae in the cap trichodermium, (Smith(34)). Suillus clintonianus grows under larch, has brighter colors, and the underside of the annulus is ochraceous instead of purple or grayish purple, (Smith(34)). Suillus glandulosipes [as Suillus neoalbidipes] which has also has no annular remnant can look similar to those specimens of S. luteus in which the veil separates from the stem leaving cottony patches of tissue hanging from the cap margin, (Smith(34)). Suillus borealis has no annulus, it has a vinaceous-red reaction in the stem base where larval damage is extensive, and the glandular dots slowly become readily visible, (Smith(36)). Suillus acidus is somewhat similar but has black viscid dots on the stem below the annulus which has a distinctive band-like form, (Ammirati as Suillus subolivaceus). Suillus flavidus is somewhat similar (Ammirati).

They comment, "Suillus placidus has a white pileus that does not change color as the specimen ages; the species was described from Germany but is strictly associated with introduced North American P. strobus (Bonorden 1861). It is thought that this species was introduced to Europe with its North American P. strobus host. Suillus subalpinus is a high-altitude species that associates with soft pines. Suillus anomalus has pores that continue down the stipe, and although it morphologically appears to be distinct, its ITS sequence was not." RANGE in the Nguyen(3) study, Suillus placidus collections were included from Europe and the eastern United States (MA, NH, NY), 4 Suillus subalpinus collections from Montana and 1 from California, and a Suillus anomalus collection from Washington with a closely related sample from British Columbia. Other authors have reported as follows: Suillus placidus is found in eastern Canada south to NC, and SC, west to MN, and is also reported from WA, (Bessette). It is found specifically in ON, PQ, ME, MI, NH, NY, TN, and VT, and it is reported by Isaacs and Stuntz from WA, (Smith). Grund recorded it from NS. It also occurs in Europe (Breitenbach). Bessette(3) gives the range of Suillus subalpinus as Wyoming and of Suillus anomalus as California.

NAME ORIGIN  means 'false [Suillus] brevipes'
SIMILAR  Suillus brevipes lacks a partial veil and annulus (Bessette). S. brevipes is similar in having a short stem but lacks a partial veil and has a darker cap, (Arora). S. brevipes is less distinctly streaked, (McKnight). Suillus brunnescens has a partial veil but not an annulus, and it has a white cap when young that becomes yellow-brown to lilac-brown when mature and stains vinaceous, then brownish when bruised, (Bessette). Suillus luteus has conspicuous glandular dots, and has narrower hyphae in the gelatinous cap trichoderm, (Smith). Sometimes the veil of S. pseudobrevipes persists as a roll of cottony tissue on the cap margin and does not form a distinct annulus, leading to confusion with such species as Suillus brunnescens and S. glandulosipes, (Arora).

LATIN NAMES  Suillus quiescens  T.D. Bruns & E.C. Vellinga^  Mycologia 102(2): 442. 2010
ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  Features include 1) a glutinous cap that is light brown becoming darker, 2) a cap margin that is inrolled with a narrow sterile zone, 3) white flesh that is unchanging or slightly changing, 4) radially elongate yellow pores less than 1 mm wide, 5) a short stem that is yellow at the top and white to yellow lower down, the stem decorated with fine glandular dots, 6) fruiting in small groups with pines between November and March, and 7) microscopic characters including both 2-spored and 4-spored basidia in most collections. The description is derived from Bruns(1). Colors in single quotation marks are from Kelly(4). RANGE Suillus quiescens was described from CA (Santa Cruz Island in Santa Barbara County, also found at Point Reyes National Seashore north of San Francisco). Fruitbodies have not yet been identified in Oregon or Washington, but molecular sequences closely match those recovered from mycorrhizae of pine seedlings in Oregon. The lack of observed fruiting could be because the species has been confused with S. brevipes, but it does not appear to be a common fruiter even in some areas where sequences have been retrieved. (Bruns). Nguyen three uses two collections from OR that specify EM root, and one that does not.
CHEMICAL REACTIONS  
CAP  6-12cm across, "broad, hemispheric to broadly convex"; approaching 'strong brown' or 'deep brown' when mature, "sometimes with olivaceous patches or tones", much paler when young but still some shade of 'light brown', or between 'light brown' and 'light orange', or grayish yellow; covered with a glutinous layer, the gluten "often drying in strands to give a slightly fibrillose look to older specimens"; margin inrolled when young "with a limited sterile zone of a millimeter or less"
FLESH  white, generally unchanging, sometimes with brownish stains just under the cap surface, and pale yellow just above tubes; in stem "white and unchanging, but sometimes with orangish stains in older or insect-damaged parts"
PORES  mature pores radially elongate but generally less than 1 mm wide; tubes when young near 'pale yellow' and "with light brown or yellowish brown glandular secretions", older tubes slightly lighter than 'brilliant orange yellow', becoming near 'olivaceous yellow'
STEM  typically 2-4cm long but sometimes longer (6-8cm), equal or slightly bulbous, or tapered to base; 'pale yellow' to 'light yellow' on the top fifth, the lower part the same color as top or white or overlaid with a 'light brown' layer or streaks of gluten as on the cap, occasionally this overlay giving the impression of an annular zone; surface finely glandular, glands at first only slightly darker than surface but sometimes light brown, becoming nearly black after drying

NAME ORIGIN  "refers to the species' ability to lay quiescent in the spore bank until it encounters pine roots", (Bruns)
SIMILAR  Fruitbodies are similar to Suillus brevipes but the cap of S. quiescens is paler, the stem apex is yellowish, and with maturity there are fine glandular dots at the top of the stem, (Bruns). Suillus glandulosipes also has an inrolled margin when young, but in contrast to that species Suillus quiescens has only a small sterile zone that one might need a hand lens to see, (Bruns). Suillus pungens of California has more prominent glandular dots on stem, has a white cap when immature, and has strong olivaceous tones before becoming similar in color to older S. quiescens, (Bruns).

ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  'Xerocomellus' mendocinensis has been known by the misapplied name Boletus truncatus (an eastern North American species). It is almost the same as Xerocomellus chrysenteron but with truncate spores. (Note that while truncate spores are "conspicuously truncate" for Boletus truncatus in Thiers(1), truncate spores are not mentioned in the Thiers(1) description of Boletus mendocinensis as a new species. If the holotype does not in fact have truncate spores a different species epithet would be needed for this taxon.) Features include 1) a dry, finely velvety cap that is dark olive-brown when young lightening to olive-tan to medium brown, the cap surface cracking in its outer part to reveal flesh that is usually not pinkish, 2) yellowish flesh (reddish to tan near stem base), that bruises blue slowly to quickly, 3) a pore surface that is yellow (sometimes orange-red) when young, quickly bluing where bruised, the pores irregularly round to angular, 4) an equal stem that is yellow when young but soon covered with dense reddish dots and often washed red almost to the top, often with a contrasting red girdle just below the yellow at the top, and 5) elongate spores, many with a strongly truncate (squared-off) end.^ Apparently the DNA sequence of the type of Boletus mendocinensis Thiers matches sequences of truncate-spored Xerocomellus in California. Strangely, the type description of Boletus mendocinensis describes longer spores that are not truncate: "15-21(27) X 4-5(6) um, narrowly cylindric in face view, slightly inequilateral in profile, giant spores and pleomorphism rather common"..."The absence of any amyloid reaction or truncate apex in the spores readily distinguishes it from B. truncatus and related species" (Thiers(1) using a mu character rather than u in the unit of measurement). Thiers(1) distinguishes Boletus truncatus (described separately from Boletus mendocinensis) from Boletus chrysenteron primarily on the character that at least a majority of the spores are truncate, but also says that Boletus truncatus does not usually show the characteristic red or reddish pigment in the cracks that Boletus chrysenteron shows, (Thiers(1)). Siegel(2) say "Reliable identification of the cracked-cap boletes in our area [Redwood Coast of California] is difficult and is more reliably done after experience with all of the species involved and the range of variation shown by each one. In comparison to the other Xerocomellus in our area, the relatively dark, moderately cracked cap, quick blue staining, and extensively red, punctate stipe are good clues." The description is derived from Siegel(2) except where otherwise noted. RANGE 'Xerocomellus' mendocinensis is known from CA and is thought to be a preferred name for the Pacific Northwest species that has been known as Boletus truncatus. That species has been reported from BC, WA, OR, and ID, (Both).

Xerocomellus 'diffractus' (previously known by the misapplied name Boletus chrysenteron) has a less extensively red stem, an often paler cap, and slower blue-staining, (Siegel(2)). Xerocomellus 'atropurpureus' "can appear similar, but has a dark blackish purple to wine red, wrinkled to smooth cap that doesn't become cracked and pores that rarely stain blue", (Siegel). Xerocomellus rainisiae "has a thick velvety-tomentose cap skin that only cracks in age", has a golden yellow stem with a reddish blush at the base, "and stains intensely dark blue-green when handled" (especially on the stem), (Siegel(2)). Xerocomellus zelleri is somewhat similar but it is usually darker in color with a pale marginal band, and pores rarely stain blue.

The staining reactions are described this way: instant greenish black staining of cap when handled or bruised, instant green then greenish black staining of stem when handled or bruised, and instant blueing of flesh and tubes when exposed. The greenish tint to the staining on cap and stem can in fact appear more blue - the exact color can be affected by moisture and age.^ Bessette subsequently noted that the observations used for the descriptions were made on rather wet specimens (Alan Bessette, pers. comm.). The description here is derived from Bessette(3). RANGE Xerocomellus rainisiae is found in WA and possibly CA (Bessette(3)). Norm Evans has photographed what appears to be this species from BC.

Features of the group include 1) a dry, blackish to dark purplish brown or dark olive-brown cap, often reddening somewhat, sometimes with a paler margin, the surface often bumpy, velvety, or with a powdery bloom, often becoming areolate [cracked like dried mud] when old, 2) white to pale yellow flesh that sometimes turns blue, 3) moderate-sized, round to irregular yellow pores that sometimes turn blue, 4) a striate stem that is yellow to tan with red granules at first and becomes dark red in its upper part or throughout, 5) growth on the ground or on wood, and 6) microscopic characters.^ The online Species Fungorum, accessed February 11, 2018, gave the current name of this species as Xerocomellus zelleri (Murrill) Klofac, but MycoBank, accessed the same day, gave the current name as Xerocomus (Murrill) Snell. RANGE Xerocomellus zelleri is common in Pacific Northwest south through CA and into Mexico, (Bessette), occurs in BC, WA, and OR (Snell), and has been reported from ID (Drew Parker pers. comm.).

SIMILAR  Xerocomellus 'atropurpureus' has these provisional differentiating morphological features: 1) X. 'atropurpureus' "more often has a reddish purple to wine-purple cap (usually lacking a distinct pale margin), whereas X. zelleri caps tend to be darker" - "blackish purple to olivaceous black with a distinctly paler margin", 2) the young caps of X. zelleri "are often slightly velvety" (as opposed to glabrous on X. 'atropurpureus'.), (Siegel(2) with Latin italicized). Boletus chrysenteron [see Xerocomellus 'diffractus'] has paler brown cap that becomes conspicuously areolate [cracked like dried mud] when old, with reddish flesh showing in the cracks, (Bessette). In deciding macroscopically between Xerocomellus zelleri and X. 'diffractus' /X. mendocinensis, a very dark pruinose cap means X. zelleri; a very areolate cap [with cracks like dried mud] with red in the cracks means X. 'diffractus' or X. mendocinensis, but microscopic examination of the spores and cap cuticle is often necessary to distinguish X. mendocinensis and X. 'diffractus' respectively from X. zelleri.

NOTES  Features include 1) a dull olive to yellowish brown cap that is velvety to somewhat tomentose, with yellowish cracks when old, 2) whitish flesh that may turn blue with exposure, 3) large and often compound angular yellow pores that may turn blue when bruised, and 4) a yellow stem with reddish brown marks and stains and sometimes a partial reticulum.^ This group includes 'Xerocomus' oregonensis and other species. There are probably several species in this group (as defined by its morphological characters in the descriptions below), and it seems likely that the species name or names will eventually change for the Pacific Northwest. Wu, G.(1) is a molecular study indicating that Xerocomus tomentosus and a few other species constitute a clade closely related to Phylloporus. RANGE Xerocomus subtomentosus group is found from eastern Canada south to NC, west to CA, north to AK, (Bessette). There are collections from OR and ID at the University of Washington. It occurs in WA (Michelle Seidl, pers. comm.), and is reported from BC (in Redhead), and NS (Grund). This species is said to occur in Europe, Asia, N. Africa, and N. America, (Breitenbach).

SIMILAR  Boletus 'spadiceus' [here treated as a synonym of Boletus 'ferrugineus'] has a cap that may be more reddish brown, and pores may turn blue more readily, but it is reliably separated by a drop of ammonium hydroxide on cap which gives a fleeting blue-green to blue-black reaction in B. 'spadiceus', (Arora). See also SIMILAR section of Xerocomellus 'diffractus', Hortiboletus rubellus, and Phylloporus arenicola.
