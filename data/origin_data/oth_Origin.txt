LATIN NAMES  Acrasis rosea  L.S. Olive & Stoian.^  Bull. Torrey Bot. Club 87: 3. 1960
ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  Acrasis rosea is included as an example of Phylum Acrasiomycota in the Kingdom Protozoa. It is known as a cellular slime mold (Dictyosteliomycetes are also cellular slime molds). While these organisms have been studied by mycologists, they would not be considered fungi according to Bryce Kendrick's definition of fungi: "Fungi are eukaryotic (their cells have nuclei), heterotrophic (they can't make their own food), osmotrophic (they absorb, don't digest, food), develop a rather diffuse, branched, tubular body (radiating hyphae making up mycelia or colonies), and reproduce by means of spores". RANGE of Acrasis rosea is not well known. Individual A. rosea amoebae feed and divide. Under adverse conditions, the amoebae can form microcysts. Upon exhaustion of their food supply, the amoebae aggregate together and form a multicellular mass that produces the spore-producing body. The mature spore-producing bodies have a cellular stem and branches that are chains of spores; the spores then separate and germinating into amoeba. There is no known sexual reproduction.

ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  Allomyces arbusculus is included as an example from the Phylum Chytridiomycota in the Kingdom Eumycota. "The vegetative phases of chytridiomycetes vary widely in appearance, but they all produce zoospores with a single, posteriorly directed, whiplash flagellum." Allomyces arbusculus exhibits alternation of generations, a rotation between haploid forms (with one set of chromosomes) and diploid forms (with two sets). Sporangia produce 1) haploid growths that produce gametes (in specialized male and female organs), which unite to grow into hyphae, and 2) diploid forms that produce flagellate zoospores which germinate into hyphae. Resting sporangia can survive for 30 years. (Kendrick 1992). RANGE It occurs on most continents, including temperate climates, and including the United States, Central and South America, South Africa, China, and India (Wolf). An internet distribution map shows also Canada and the United Kingdom.

ENGLISH NAMES  Eastern filbert blight
NOTES  Features include longitudinal, slightly depressed cankers on hazelnut (filbert) trees. In the mature state the cankers contain numerous hard, dark brown to black stromata (also known as pustules), each about 0.2-1cm long, and each with numerous ostioles.^ Ascospores infect young vegetative tissue in spring (during bud break and early shoot extension) and the fungus colonizes cambial tissue. Stromata containing perithecia develop within the cankers 12-16 months after infection. Stromata form at the margins of cankers each year, so that the cankers expand every year. In Corylus avellana, these cankers eventually girdle branches, causing death of mature trees in 5-15 years. This is known as eastern filbert blight, a destructive disease of Corylus avellana (European hazelnut) which is cultivated commercially in the Pacific Northwest and other areas. Corylus americana (American hazelnut) is affected only in minor ways. (EPPO(1)). Celeste Paley (pers. comm.) has reported it on Corylus cornutus var. californica in BC. RANGE Anisogramma anomala is found at least in BC, NS, WA, OR, CT, DE, IL, IA, ME, MD, MA, NJ, NY, NC, WI. It occurs naturally on wild Corylus spp. in the eastern United States - it spread to WA in 1973, OR in 1986, and from these states to BC. (EPPO(1))
FRUITING BODY  About 5-100 stromata are formed per canker, with 40-60 perithecia per stroma. At an early stage the only external symptom is a series of small bumps 0.2-0.3cm across and less than 0.05cm in height. Lens-shaped fissures containing white mycelium form in the bark. Later visible cankers form, containing stromata. "The stroma is the most conspicuous and most diagnostic character of the fungus. Stromata usually occur in single or double rows within 1-yr-old cankers. In 2- or 3-yr-old perennial cankers, three to five rows of stromata, also known as pustules, are not uncommon. Mature stromata are aligned with their greatest length parallel to the long axis of the stem" and measure 0.2-1.0cm x 0.15-0.3cm and 0.1-0.2cm in height. "First season cankers usually contain less than 20 stromata while in second or third-season cankers, stromata often number in the hundreds." "Death of the cambium in the area of the canker results in a sunken appearance as the surrounding cambium continues to grow." Gottwald(1). Mature stromata are black and measure 1.5-3cm x 0.2–1.0cm and 0.1-0.2cm in height. (EPPO(2)). Stromata are variable in shape from round in outline to ellipsoid. Sometimes they are raised pustules and at other times they occur in a depression or groove in the twig/branch. (Thom O'Dell, pers. comm.)
HABITAT  on stems, branches, and twigs of Corylus spp.
MICROSCOPIC  spores unequally two celled, colorless, the smaller cell remaining as a hemispheric cap measuring 1.1-1.4 x 1.1 microns, and the larger enlarging slowly from July to November from 5-6 x 2-2.5 microns to 8-12 x 4-5 microns at maturity^; spore release is typically from November to April; asci are 8-spored - mature asci are 45-65 x 10-15 microns with a long thread-like stalk, within the asci, spores are uniseriate to biseriate; paraphyses are not present in some perithecia and occur in low number in others - they are 40-50 microns long and 3.5 microns at greatest width, and they are short-lived and gelatinize before full development of the ascocarp; the mature perithecium is 1040-2160 microns x 250-830 microns, (Gottwald(1) who provide considerable further microscopic detail in their study of infections in C. avellanea)
NAME ORIGIN  means 'anomalous' Peck described it as a species of Diatrype and said in the original description "The peculiar and anomalous character of this species is found in its unusual spores and it its attacking living stems."

ENGLISH NAMES  black knot of cherry
NOTES  Apiosporina morbosa causes the destructive and very common disfiguring black knot of Prunus (wild cherry, plum, etc.), (Bessette et al. 1997). Individual branches are deformed and if infection is severe for several years, the infected tree may become stunted. During April and May ascospores (produced by overwintering fruitbodies) usually infect the youngest branches and occasionally the larger branches or the trunk. Internally the fruitbody consists of both fungal cells and host cells (increased amounts of xylem and phloem through hypertrophy). The conidial state develops on the fruitbody early in the spring and the asci develop later.^ RANGE Apiosporina morbosa is common throughout Canada but by 1976 was still restricted to North America. The distribution in Canada includes BC, AB, MB, NF, NS, ON, PQ, and SK, (Corlett).
FRUITING BODY  3.5-14cm long and 1-2.5cm thick, spindle-shaped to club-shaped or irregular elongated swellings; "surface hard, black, carbonaceous, finely roughened, typically furrowed and cracked"; no stem; "flesh white when very young, soon black and brittle; perithecia embedded near the surface in a single layer"; not edible^, (Bessette), large, variable in size, developing in branches, becoming erumpent, at first olive-green but becoming black and hard, (Corlett)

FAMILY  Anamorphic Fungi
LATIN NAMES  Arthrobotrys species^
ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  This genus is included because some members have a fascinating method for consuming nematodes (roundworms). 'Fungi can capture nematodes in a variety of ways but the most sophisticated and perhaps the most dramatic is called the constricting ring. An erect branch from a hypha curves around and fuses with itself to form a three-celled ring about 20-30 microns in diameter (30/1000th mm). When a nematode "swims" into a ring it triggers a response in the fungus and the three cells expand rapidly inwards with such power that they constrict the body of the nematode victim and hold it securely with no chance to escape. It takes only 1/10 th of a second for the ring cells to inflate to their maximum size.' Scanning electron microscope studies resulted in the picture shown (N. Allin and G.L. Barron). They show "that there is a rip in the outer wall of the ring cells, and that a new wall has expanded into the center of the ring". The results suggest 'that there is a hair trigger line of weakness running along the inside wall of the constricting ring cells. When this is touched by a nematode or other mechanical force the cell is triggered with the following sequence of events. 1. The line of weakness breaks. 2. The osmotic pressure of the cell results in rapid intake of water over the surface of the cell. 3. The cell expands in the direction of the break with a resulting 3X increase in cell volume. 4. The reserve wall and membrane materials are located at the point of the break and reorganize to form new wall and membrane. 5. The three times increase in volume must result in a three times decrease in osmotic pressure of the ring cells at the time of expansion. 6. The ring cells "cushion" around the body of the nematode and hold it fast but do not constrict it at that point in time. 7. There is a rapid conversion of reserve materials in the ring cells to allow the OP of the cell to recover. When the OP of the rings cells exceeds that of the nematode cells then the nematode wall will collapse and the body will be constricted. 8. In its struggles to escape the nematode will often put its tail into a second ring and be held immobile. 9. Once captured the ring cells will germinate and invasive hyphae penetrate into the living body of the nematode, grow throughout the body and digest the contents. This will be accomplished within 12-24 hours. The food gained from this will be translocated elsewhere for further growth and production of more traps or for producing the reproductive bodies of the fungus which in this case is called Arthrobotrys anchonia.' (The illustrated species is Arthrobotrys anchonia.) Arthrobotrys brochopaga which is isolated from soil in California also uses constricting rings to consume nematodes.

FAMILY  Anamorphic Fungi
LATIN NAMES  Aspergillus species^
ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  Aspergillus oryzae is used in the Far East to turn soya protein into such delicacies as soy sauce, miso, and the Indonesian ket-jap (the source of the name for ketchup). Several Aspergillus species are implicated in spoilage of wheat in storage. Aspergillus flavus is a common mold that occurs on many grains in storage and is even used to produce some kinds of vegetable cheese and soy sauce: however it is a source of very potent carcinogens called aflatoxins under certain conditions, and peanuts contaminated with these toxins may be the cause of increased liver cancer rates in some countries. Several Aspergillus species can also grow in the human body causing disease particularly under conditions of immune suppression. Bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is usually caused by Aspergillus fumigatus, which colonizes mucus in the bronchial tubes, evoking a severe allergic reaction. Aspergillus clavatus produces one of the toxins implicated in nerve damage cause by home-brewed sorghum beer. Aspergillus niger is a black-spored mould of bread and also causes black mould rot of vegetables. (Kendrick). Aspergillosis is most commonly caused by Aspergillus fumigatus, but A. flavus, A. niger, and several other species can cause disease. Inhalation of Aspergillus spores must be extremely common, as the species of Aspergillus involved in disease are ubiquitous in the environment, growing on dead leaves, compost piles, hay, and other decaying vegetation. Invasion of lung tissue is confined almost exclusively to immunocompromised people. Massive inhalation of spores by healthy people can result in an acute lung inflammation, which usually recovers spontaneously within a few weeks. Aspergillus is also a cause of allergic fungal sinusitis in generally healthy people, but dark walled species such as Cladosporium and Alternaria are more common in this situation. (Braunwald et al. 2001). Aspergillus species are anamorphic (asexual) fungi, with corresponding teleomorphs (sexual forms) in the Ascomycete order Eurotiales (see NOTES under Trichophyton species).

ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis is included as an example of fungi in the Phylum Chytridiomycota. It has been associated with amphibian declines in multiple continents, including western North America. Where Oregon spotted frogs were sampled in OR and WA, 36 of 36 sites and 420 of 617 individuals showed evidence B. dendrobatis. (Pearlet al. 2009). Chytridiomycota has 105 genera and 706 species worldwide. Chytrids are aquatic saprobes or parasites growing on decaying and living organic material including nematodes, insects, amphibian skin, plant parts, chytrids and other fungi. The thallus is coenocytic (multinucleate non-septate), holocarpic (whole thallus used for fruitbody) or eucarpic (fruitbody limited to part of thallus), monocentric, polycentric, or mycelial. Cell walls are chitinous (at least in hyphal stages). Mitochondrial cristae are flat. Zoospores are posteriorly (whiplash) monoflagellate or (rarely) polyflagellate.

FRUITING BODY  "The fungus produces inoperculate, smooth-walled zoosporangia (zoospore containing bodies), which are spherical to subspherical in shape." Each zoosporangium (10 microns to 40 microns in diameter) "produces a single discharge tube, which penetrates (and protrudes out of) the skin. Eventually the plug that blocks the release of immature zoospores is shed and the mature zoospores are released."

NOTES  Botrytis causes gray mold of strawberries, (as well as lettuce, tomato, etc.) It has been combatted with the fungicide, Captan. The mycoparasite Gliocladium roseum (an anamorphic fungus) can also control Botrytis. The crucial stage in the development of the problem is during the flowering of the strawberry, before the fruit forms. "An ingenious delivery system has been designed, in which honey bees leaving the hive are automatically dusted with about 50,000 Gliocladium conidia, which they deliver directly to the flowers." Interestingly Botrytis cinerea is used in the making of some sweet wines. The best Sauternes are made this way, as are the German "Trochenbeerenauslesen" and the Hungarian Tokay. The fungus 'causes the "noble rot" - "pourriture noble" in France, "Edelfaul" in Germany, "aszu" in Hungary. In good years, the grapes are left on the vines until they are overripe, and the Botrytis grows on them. The grapes crack open, the mould lives on the juice, and the sugar content increases. At just the right stage, they are ultimately individually picked, all mouldy and shrivelled, and made into wine.' (Kendrick).

LATIN NAMES  Candida albicans  (C.P. Robin) Berkhout^  De Schimmelgesl. Monilia, Oidum, Oospora en Torula, Disset. Ultrecht: 44. 1923
ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  Candida albicans is the cause in humans of yeast vaginitis, and of "thrush" infections in the mouth. It is part of the normal flora of many people, but exists in a balance with other organisms. When this balance is upset, for instance by antibiotics or birth control pills, symptoms may result. If the immune system is compromised by immune-suppressive drugs or by diseases like AIDS, infection can be more generalized and even threaten life. Candida albicans is an anamorphic fungus (see NOTES under Trichophyton species). It is not known to reproduce sexually and appears to be permanently diploid (with two complete sets of chromosomes). It may produce "pseudomycelium and mycelium as well as yeast cells both in culture and in host tissue; however, the morphology is variable depending on the fungal strain, host organism, and even the infection site within the host." (Alexopoulos et al. 1996). Something can be said here about yeasts in general. According to Alexopoulos et al., a yeast is "a single-celled fungus that reproduces by budding or fission." Species in the Saccharomycetales are often designated as true yeasts and include Saccharomyces (used in the making of bread and beer) and Candida. These do not produce a ascocarp (fruiting body). The term yeast-like often is used also to refer to other groups with budding yeast cells. (Alexopoulos et al.). The term may be defined more widely, as by Bryce Kendrick: yeasts are "fungi which in many cases are unicellular, though some produce hyphae: most yeasts are anamorphs; their cells are conidia, and they multiply by various kinds of conidiogenesis. Some can produce asci, some can form basidia, and some appear to be anamorphic holomorphs - entirely asexual." Defined this way, yeasts are not necessarily related closely to each other taxonomically. (Kendrick 1992). RANGE widespread

ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  Also listed in Clubs category. Claviceps purpurea is usually seen as a dark-colored, hard, elongate, somewhat bent sclerotium in the panicle of grasses. It also forms (the next year) a fruiting body divided into an ocher to orange-yellow head and a sinuous reddish brown stem growing on the old sclerotium.^ Claviceps purpurea infects rye: if the sclerotia (which contain ergot alkaloids) are eaten by cattle, or if ergot-containing rye bread is eaten by humans, a form of poisoning results called ergotism or St. Anthony's fire (hallucinations, burning feelings, gangrene). Claviceps purpurea infects rye through the stigma when the rye is in flower. The mycelium produces masses of asexual spores (conidia) in a sweet smelling nectar, which causes it to be spread by insects to other plants. Then the mycelial mat hardens and forms a purplish sclerotium that falls to the ground and germinates the following spring. Each sclerotium produces several stromata that consist of a stem and a spherical head within which the perithecia develop with their ascospores. Claviceps was the original source of LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide), the potent psychedelic drug. RANGE Claviceps purpurea is widespread. There are collections specifically from BC, AB, IA, and Germany at the University of British Columbia, and from WA, AK, and New Zealand at the University of Washington.
FRUITING BODY  divided into head and stem, fertile head rounded to flattened, 0.15-0.3cm; ocher to orange-yellow; with fine dark punctation; stem 0.5-1.5cm x 0.1-0.15cm, cylindric, sinuous; reddish brown; smooth; "attached by a white hyphal feltwork to the blackish, grooved, often somewhat bent sclerotium", single to a few on a sclerotium^, (Breitenbach), head spherical, commonly about 0.2cm across, cream to purple, dotted with the darker slightly protruding ostioles of the perithecia; sclerotia "elongated, more or less cylindrical with rounded ends but usually with slight longitudinal grooves and ridges", "varying greatly in size and shape according to the species of grass infected", black externally with hard white flesh; stem slender, cylindric; pale purple; smooth, (Dennis), spherical head ochraceous brown or pale purple; spotted; stem long, thin; colored as head; smooth, (Lincoff)

ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  Coccomyces dentatum is included as an example of the ascomycete order Rhytismatales. This is the most frequently collected species of Coccomyces. It is common and widespread and in the Pacific Northwest is often found growing on dead leaves of Mahonia sp. (Oregon grape). Fruitbodies up to 0.1cm wide open out as squares, pentagons, or hexagons, often on a paler part of the host that is surrounded by a black line. Each fruitbody has a grayish or grayish yellow spore-bearing surface, a pale margin, and a shiny black exterior.^ Coccomyces dentatus (Kunze ik Schm. ex Fr.) Sacc. var. hexagonus Penz. & Sacc. is a name applied to large specimens of Coccomyces dentatus with regular, hexagonal apothecia from the western U.S., but studying the type material is problematic. (Sherwood). RANGE Collections were examined from BC, WA, OR, ID, AZ, CA, FL, LA, NC, PA, TN, VA, Panama, Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, France, Germany, Italy, Tunisia, Canary islands, (Sherwood). It occurs also in the United Kingdom (Sherwood).
FRUITING BODY  Fruitbodies are up to 0.1cm wide, with a translucent gray or grayish yellow spore-bearing surface, "paler margins, and shiny black exteriors". They are immersed in the substrate at first, and then open "as squares or pentagons". The fruitbodies "grow within a paler part of the host, which is surrounded by a black line." (Thompson(1)). Fruitbodies are 0.05-0.1cm in diameter, "quadrate to hexagonal, black, shining", with a distinct star-shaped, preformed dehiscence mechanism of lighter colored cells, "opening by teeth to expose the dull yellow hymenium". Fruitbodies are "scattered in prominent bleached spots bounded by a black line, intraepidermal, usually accompanied by pycnidia". Pycnidia are 0.1-0.3 mm diameter "appearing before the apothecia mature". (Sherwood).
HABITAT  on "dead (rarely living) leaves of a wide variety of angiosperms, notably on Fagaceae and Ericaceae, widespread and common, chiefly in warm temperate areas, summer and fall in the northern part of its range, throughout the year in subtropical areas", (Sherwood)

SIMILAR  There are at least nine other Coccomyces species in the Pacific Northwest. 1) Coccomyces arbutifolius was described from BC on Arbutus menziesii leaves (apparently living leaves). The leaves are marked by a faint superficial bloom but there is no bleaching or encircling line, and both ascospores and asci are larger. 2) Coccomyces arctostaphyli, recorded from OR, AB, and Europe, is inconspicuous on leaves of Arctostaphylos uva-ursi (kinnikinnick). 3) Coccomyces castanopsidis, found in OR and CA, is up to 0.4cm across with a bright yellow hymenium, and grows on dead bark and wood of Castanopsis (chinquapin) and Quercus chrysolepis (Canyon Live Oak). 4) Coccomyces heterophyllae occurs on twigs of Tsuga heterophylla (Western Hemlock) in the coastal forests of BC and WA in spring and summer. 5) Coccomyces ledi grows on living twigs of Rhododendron groenlandicum (Labrador-tea) and R. tomentosum (northern Labrador-tea), late summer and early fall, and is common in arctic and alpine localities (including BC, OR, MB, NT, NH, Europe, and Asia). 6) Coccomyces leptideus is common on living and recently killed twigs of Vaccinium myrtillus (bilberry), V. vitis-idaea (lingonberry), Rhododendron macrophyllum (Pacific rhododendron), and Gaultheria shallon (salal). Spores are either 4-spored, with spores 60-90 x 4(5) microns, or 8-spored, with spores 60-90 x 3.0-3.5 microns. It grows in summer and fall, in WA, OR, and Europe. Coccomyces gaultheriae is distinguished from C. leptideus by its shorter, broader ascospores 19-22 x 6-6.5 microns. [C. gaultheriae has been recorded from twigs of Gaultheria shallon from BC by Adolf and Oluna Ceska]. 7) Coccomyces parvulus grows on decorticated wood of various conifers in WA and OR. The colonies look like charred wood and the fruitbodies are only 0.03-0.08cm across and round to elongate, up to twice as long as they are wide. 8) Coccomyces pseudotsugae produces black fruitbodies 0.06-0.12cm across on bark of Pseudotsuga menziesii (Douglas-fir) and Abies grandis (Grand Fir), and has been found in BC, WA, and CA, 9) Coccomyces tumidus produces relatively large, fleshy, rugose, dark brown fruitbodies 0.1-0.2cm across, round to elongated, with a dull yellow to yellowish tan spore-bearing surface. They grow on long dead leaves of a variety of hardwood trees especially oak and beech and other plants including salal and Rubus. The fruitbodies are on bleached areas of the leaf, usually surrounded by a black line. Distribution includes WA, OR, MA, ME, NH, NY, VA, NS, ON, and Europe. 10) Coccomyces coronatus of Europe and eastern North America, with which C. dentatus is frequently confused, "has inflated paraphyses, longer asci and ascospores, less regular apothecia, and rarely occurs on leaves of evergreens". (Sherwood). Kroeger(5) reported C. tumidus from salal in Haida Gwaii, BC.

LATIN NAMES  Cryptococcus neoformans  (San Felice) Vuill.^  Rev. Gen. Sci. Pures Appl. 12: 747-750. 1901
ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  Cryptococcus neoformans var. gattii, now known as Cryptococcus gattii, hit the headlines in 2002 in BC, with headlines starting "Killer fungus". Cryptococcosis is a fungal disease, usually presenting in humans as a subacute or chronic meningitis or as pneumonia. Early symptoms of meningitis include headache, nausea, staggering gait, dementia, irritability, confusion, and blurred vision. Fever and neck stiffness are often mild or absent. Infection often occurs in lungs (chest pain in 40% of lung infections, cough in 20%, shortness of breath, positive chest X-ray), but may occur in bone (4%), kidneys (rare), prostate (rare), liver (rare), heart (rare), or eyes (rare), and other symptoms may include weight loss, fever, and night sweats. The skin may show acne-like lesions, ulcers, or subcutaneous tumor-like masses (skin lesions occurring in 10% of cases). Untreated meningitis terminates fatally within several months (from two weeks to several years). Sporadic cases appear in many parts of the world, affecting mainly adults, and men twice as often as women. Transmission is not understood thoroughly but presumably occurs by inhalation: it does not appear to be contagious from person to person. The incubation period is unknown, probably about 2-9 months, and lung infection may precede meningitis by months or years. The frequency of Cryptococcus in the external environment and the rarity of disease suggests that most people have some resistance. At some point in their lives, most people are likely to inhale the fungal spores without developing an infection. Disease is more common when immunity is lowered: about 8% of untreated persons with AIDS in USA and Africa have developed cryptococcosis, usually by Cryptococcus neoformans var. neoformans. Infections with Cryptococcus gattii have been rare among AIDS patients and other immunocompromised patients, even in subtropical climates, where C. gattii infections occurs in previously healthy people. Infection occurs in 40 animals including cats, dogs, horses, cows, monkeys, ferrets, porpoises, and llamas, but infection does not appear to be transmitted to people from animals. C. neoformans var. neoformans can be isolated from pigeon droppings or soil. C. neoformans var. gatti can be isolated from plants or decaying plant material especially in tropical or subtropical areas. In Australia C. gatti is found in Eucalyptus. In 2002, on eastern Vancouver Island in BC, a cluster of cases of Cryptococcus gattii infection in humans led to the discovery of the fungus in the bark of Douglas fir, Grand Fir, Western Red-cedar, Garry Oak, and Red Alder. 52 cases were identified from 1999 to mid-2002, with one fatality, where previously the average had been 2-3 per year of the C. neoformans infections. The most common presentation was lung infection: 25 percent also had meningitis. The fungus grows well on appropriate media. Coculture of opposite mating types creates a transient diploid state called Filobasidiella neoformans var. neoformans for C. neoformans var. neoformans and Filobasidiella neoformans var. bacillispora for C. gattii. By 2010 the outbreak had expanded from Vancouver Island into neighboring regions including mainland BC, and WA and OR in the United States. The outbreak is caused predominantly by molecular type VGII/major. A novel genotype, VGIIc, has emerged in Oregon and is now a source of illness in the region. (combined sources).  RANGE includes BC, WA, OR
FRUITING BODY  The fungus reproduces by budding and forms round, yeast-like cells. Within the host and on certain culture media, a large polysaccharide capsule surrounds each yeast cell.

LATIN NAMES  Cumminsiella mirabilissima  (Peck) Nannf.^  in Lundell & Nannfeldt, Fungi Exsiccati Suecici: no. 1507a. 1947
ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  Cumminsiella mirabilissima is included as an example of the Uredinales (rust fungi). The rust fungi all grow on vascular plants, and often have very narrow host ranges. They do not have basidium producing fruitbodies, because basidia are produced from overwintering spores. There are up to five different types of spores specialized for different parts of the life cycle, and often two separate hosts that are taxonomically unrelated to each other. C. mirabilissima is an "autoecious" rust [all stages on one host], with its stages on Mahonia species (Oregon grape).^ The description is derived from Silverside(1), accessed October 20, 2004. RANGE C. mirabilissima is found in BC (Ginns) and presumably widely in the Pacific Northwest through the range of Mahonia.
FRUITING BODY  Aeciospores produced in aecia form on conspicuous swellings on the undersides of leaves in May and June (shown in the first and second illustrations). Urediniospores and teliospores form in structures called uredinia and telia respectively (also called uredinial sori and telial sori). "Uredinia and telia form on the undersides of the leaves - especially on overwintered leaves early in the season but also on new leaves later in the year. In this author's experience there is no clear distinction between uredinia and telia, although telia tend to be darker. The sori may consist predominantly of urediniospores but with a few teliospores present, of equal amounts of each, or predominantly of teliospores with urediniospores still present. Old infected leaves more readily develop black and red colours on the upper surface." Uredinia (also with teliospores) are shown in the third and fourth illustrations.
HABITAT  on Mahonia leaves [Oregon grape]
MICROSCOPIC  Aecial spores have a portion of the wall characteristically yellow-pigmented (shown in the fifth illustration). Teliospores have "two, rounded, more or less equal cells, on a long pedicel", while urediniospores are "pear-shaped, thick-walled and minutely spiny": these are both shown in the sixth illustration.

ENGLISH NAMES  cramp-balls, King Alfred's cakes, carbon balls
NOTES  Daldinia childiae produces spherical to top-shaped, hard fruiting bodies growing on hardwood, the surface brown vinaceous, chestnut, or grayish sepia becoming darker and dull, and the interior with alternating color zones. This species can be compared to other species in the genus by placing fragments of the outer part of the fruiting body in 10% KOH on a microscope slide and noting the color of the extracted pigment if any. The English name cramp-balls is based on the belief in the United Kingdom that carrying them on one's person would prevent or relieve leg cramps. The English name King Alfred's cakes indicates a resemblance to cakes burned while the king fell asleep. This species has often been identified as Daldinia concentrica (Bolton: Fr.) Ces. & De Not. var. concentrica (found in the United Kingdom).^ D. childiae is common in North America, Europe, and elsewhere (Ju). RANGE Collections of Daldinia childiae were examined from ID, HI, IN, MI, MN, NH, WI, Mexico, France, India, (Ju).
FRUITING BODY  0.5-5cm across, 0.8-4cm high, spherical, depressed-spherical to turbinate [top-shaped], brown vinaceous, chestnut, or grayish sepia, darkened and dull when old; smooth or with inconspicuous to conspicuous perithecial mounds; dull orange brown or dull reddish brown granules immediately below surface, with KOH extractable pigments isabelline, hazel, honey, amber, or cinnamon; the flesh between the perithecia pithy to woody, colored brown, the flesh below the perithecial layer pithy to woody and of alternating zones, the darker zones 0.02-0.06cm thick and dark brown, the lighter zones 0.06-0.1cm thick and brown; perithecia 0.03-0.05cm across and 0.07-0.15cm high; without a stem or with a short stem

NAME ORIGIN  after Child, who wrote a monograph on Daldinia
SIMILAR  Daldinia gelatinosa has the lighter zones gelatinous, but is most easily separable by KOH-extractable pigments that are dark livid or apparently absent, (Ju). Daldinia grandis has KOH-extractable pigments livid purple or dark livid, or apparently absent, and spores are larger. Daldinia concentrica var. concentrica (United Kingdom)differs in that 1) it has a fine network of cracks on the surface of the fruiting body which is usually larger and becomes black and varnished when old, 2) KOH-extractable pigments are livid purple or dark purple, and 3) conidia are different, (Ju). Daldinia lloydii is without apparent KOH-extractable pigments and the surface is cracked in a reticulate manner forming fulvous polygonal scales. Daldinia loculata has different KOH-extractable pigments, assuming they are the same as those in D. grandis.

LATIN NAMES  Entomophthora muscae  (Cohn) G. Winter^  Bot. Ztg. 14: 883. 1856
ENGLISH NAMES  fly fungus
NOTES  Entomophthora muscae is included as an example of Subphylum Entomophthoromycotina of Phylum Zygomycota, one of the phyla of true fungi. The principal characteristic that distinguishes Class Zygomycetes is the production by most species of a thick-walled resting spore called a zygospore. The zygospore develops within a zygosporangium that is formed after fusion of structures containing sex cells (gametangia containing gametes). (Alexopoulos et al. 1996). Entomophthora muscae infects houseflies and eventually kills them. Dying flies, their bodies riddled by fungus, usually crawl into exposed positions and may be found for instance on windows, or on growing tips of shrubs. The fungus bursts through the insect exoskeleton producing tightly packed masses of sporangiophores. Each sporangiophore bears one sticky unicellular sporangium that is shot away at maturity. When the fly dies on a window, a whitish halo of sporangia is produced on glass. The sporangia infect flies that walk nearby. (Kendrick 1992). RANGE not specified

ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  Savile (1959) differentiated this species primarily microscopically from Exobasidium vaccinii and Exobasidium vaccinii-uliginosi. Spore size, basidium size, and the number of sterigmata per basidium are more or less intermediate between those two species as Savile described them. Spore shape is clavate (nearly cylindric in E. vaccinii, broadly clavate to elliptic in E. vaccinii-uliginosi). "The habit, the frequently septate spores, and the production of conidia separate it sharply from [E. vaccinii-uliginosi]."^ A variety minor is also described which differs in spores and basidia. "This variety approaches E. vaccinii in spore size, but the clavate spores and the preponderance of basidia with three sterigmata indicate its affinity with E. cordilleranum" (Savile, Latin names italicized). RANGE Collections were examined from BC (both varieties) and from the Idaho-Montana border (var. minor), (Savile).
FRUITING BODY  forming pale spots [maculas pallidas] about 0.4-0.8cm across on leaves without hypertrophy
HABITAT  on leaves of Vaccinium parvifolium (type) and Vaccinium ovalifolium "The spores tend to be slightly smaller on V. ovalifolium than on V. parvifolium, but from the available series it is uncertain whether the difference is real. Four-spored basidia also seem to be commoner on V. ovalifolium than on the type host." (Savile)

ENGLISH NAMES  red leaf spot, azalea gall, blister blight, cowberry redleaf 
NOTES  Features include the development on plants of Ericaceae of thickened gall-like areas on leaves, which turn red on the upper surface and on the underside become covered with a white spore-bearing mat: the plants lose their leaves, bear less fruit and often die. The fungus remains in the stems and rhizomes of the plant during the winter. A true fruiting body is not produced. It affects a variety of plants including Vaccinium species (blueberry, cranberry, whortleberry etc.), Arctyostaphylos, Menziesia, Rhododendron, and Arbutus menziesii, at least in the widest sense of the name.^ Modern authors have defined the species more narrowly. Breitenbach's description is for European collections on Vaccinium vitis-idaea. Savile's concept includes the following synonyms: Exobasidium azaleae Peck, E. discoideum Ellis, E. andromedae Peck, E. karstenii Sacc. & Trotter, E. cassandrae Peck, E. ledi P. Karst., E. oxycocci Rostr., E. agauriae P. Henn., E. parvifolii Hotson, and E. angustisporum Linder. The online Species Fungorum, accessed March 30, 2012, maintained these as separate. Savile also combines Exobasidium arctostaphyli Harkn. as a var. arctostaphyli of E. vaccinii, with spores 12.5-16.5(20) x 3.3-5.0 and basidia 2-3(4)-spored, and assigns some BC collections. RANGE Numerous collections appear under this name from BC at Pacific Forestry Center, and Savile examined collections from BC, AB, NL, NS, NU, ON, QC, CA, MA, NJ (type of E. discoideum), Finland (type of E. karstenii), and Germany.
FRUITING BODY  attacks leaves, usually causing the infected places to become thickened and gall-like, and to turn bright red with yellowish border on the upper surface of the leaf, these places on the underside covered with white farinose spore-bearing surface, sometimes the whole ends of the shoots are involved and show abnormally increased growth, (Breitenbach)^, systemic, "producing shoot galls or witches'-brooms", or localized, "producing bud galls, leaf galls, or unhypertrophied leaf spots", (Savile); parasitic "in leaves, young shoots, and flowers of various ericaceous hosts, and stimulating the infected parts to the production of leaf, shoot, or flower galls" that bear the fruiting on their surface; on leaves growing flat on the underside, scurfy or felty and compact, grayish, the upper side of the leaf usually somewhat reddish, (Burt)

ENGLISH NAMES  scrambled egg slime
NOTES  Fuligo septica is included as an example of the myxomycetes or slime molds, traditionally studied with the fungi, but now included in the Kingdom Protozoa as Phylum Myxomycota. Slime molds would not be considered fungi according to Bryce Kendrick's definition of fungi: "Fungi are eukaryotic (their cells have nuclei), heterotrophic (they can't make their own food), osmotrophic (they absorb, don't digest, food), develop a rather diffuse, branched, tubular body (radiating hyphae making up mycelia or colonies), and reproduce by means of spores". Fuligo septica is common in the Pacific Northwest. RANGE F. septica is found in BC, WA, and OR, and elsewhere in the world.
FRUITING BODY  2.5-20cm long and nearly as wide, 1-3cm thick, cushion-shaped to irregular; white to yellow or ocher; slimy, when old appears crusty and cake-like; flesh "whitish to yellowish, darkening with age, becoming black, bleeding where bruised"^, (Lincoff), 2-20cm long, 1-3cm thick, cushion-shaped; white, ochraceous, greenish, pink, dull red, brown, or violet, cortex calcareous, fragile, usually rather thick and separable, plasmodium usually yellow, sometimes white or creamy, (Martin)

FAMILY  Anamorphic Fungi
LATIN NAMES  Gibellula species^
ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  Gibellula spp. are parasites on spiders. There are at least two common species in North America, Gibellula pulchra Cavara and Gibellula arachnophila (Ditmar) Vuill. (= Gibellula leiopus (Vuill. ex Maubl.) Mains). Sometimes the pyrenomycete Torrubiella is found in association, and the online Species Fungorum, accessed December 14, 2015, gives Torrubiella arachnophila (J.R. Johnst.) Mains as the current name of Gibellula arachnophila. Other anamorphs that infect spiders include Akanthomyces, Clathroconium, Engyodontium, Granulomanus, Hymenostilbe, Nomuraea, Paecilomyces, and Pseudogibellula. RANGE Mains recorded collections of Gibellula pulchra from DE, HI, ME, MA, NC, TN, Puerto Rico, Trinidad, Belize, Chile, Venezuela, and New Guinea, and collections of Gibellula arachnophila from NS, MA, MD, ME, NC, NH, NJ, NY, VA, VT, WI. There is a 1949 collection labeled Gibellula leiopus from British Columbia at the University of British Columbia. The accompanying photograph was taken in OR.
FRUITING BODY  The spider host is covered with whitish to yellowish mycelium. Growing from that base are whitish to brownish or pale violet, more or less cylindric projections up to about 1cm long and up to a third as wide but often narrower. Lining the projections as well as on the mycelium, and visible at low magnification, are capitate conidiophores.

FAMILY  Pucciniaceae, Order Pucciniales, Class Pucciniomycetes, Phylum Basidiomycota
LATIN NAMES  Gymnosporangium species^
ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  Gymnosporangium is included as an example of the Uredinales (rust fungi). The rust fungi all grow on vascular plants, and often have very narrow host ranges. They do not have basidium producing fruitbodies, because basidia are produced from overwintering spores. There are up to five different types of spores specialized for different parts of the life cycle, and often two separate hosts that are taxonomically unrelated to each other. Gymnosporangium species alternate between a conifer, like juniper, and a rosaceous host like apple or serviceberry. Teliospores (which overwinter on the conifer) are typically two-celled, each with a single transverse septum: each teliospore has a long pedicel that swells and gelatinizes when wetted. Groups of wet teliospores appear as large, orange, gelatinous masses that protrude from galls or stems and branches of the infected conifer. Basidiospores are produced then land on susceptible tissues of the rosaceous host and flask-shaped spermogonia develop in the spring. Aecia then develop and produce aeciospores then infect tissues such as needles or buds of the conifer, and the cycle begins again. RANGE widespread.

ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  Labyrinthula zosterae is included as an example of Labyrinthulomycota, a phylum of the Kingdom Chromista, as accepted by Ainsworth & Bisby's Dictionary of the Fungi 9th Edition. This nomenclature has changed so that Labyrinthula  and Labyrinthulaceae are in Labyrinthulida (instead of Labyrinthulales) of Labyrinthulea (instead of Labyrinthulomycetes) of Bigyra (instead of Labyrinthomycota). Species of Labyrinthula are typically referred to as marine slime molds, but recently they have been placed in Kingdom Chromista. Although this kingdom does contain 2 fungal phyla, these marine slime molds would not be considered fungi according to Bryce Kendrick's definition of fungi: "Fungi are eukaryotic (their cells have nuclei), heterotrophic (they can't make their own food), osmotrophic (they absorb, don't digest, food), develop a rather diffuse, branched, tubular body (radiating hyphae making up mycelia or colonies), and reproduce by means of spores". Labyrinthula is characterized by spindle-shaped cells surrounded by an ectoplasmic network. The naked cells of the Labyrinthula zosterae colony live and move entirely within a network of narrow, tubular, polysaccharide sheaths that they themselves secrete. L. zosterae is a cause of wasting disease of Zostera marina (eelgrass), the dominant seagrass in the cool temperate marine zones of the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. The disease causes dark areas on the leaves and results finally in major dieback of the eelgrass beds.^ RANGE Collections of Labyrinthula zosterae were isolated from necrotic spots and streaks on leaves of Zostera marina [eelgrass] from WA, NS, AK, CA, CT, MA, MD, ME, NC, NH, NY, RI, VA, (Muehlstein).

LATIN NAMES  Letharia columbiana  (Nutt.) J.W. Thomson^  Taxon 18: 536. 1969
ENGLISH NAMES  brown-eyed wolf, brown-eyed wolf lichen
NOTES  This species is included to pay tribute to the vast world of lichens, many of which are included in the Order Lecanorales. A lichen is a composite of a fungus and an alga. The alga combines carbon dioxide and oxygen with the sun's energy into sugars that provide energy for the fungus. The fungus protects the alga within its tissues and provides a steadier supply of moisture. This association is so successful that there are about 500 species of macrolichens in the Pacific Northwest that can be identified with a guide such as "Macrolichens of the Pacific Northwest" by Bruce McCune and Linda Geiser. Even more are covered and illustrated in the superb volume "Lichens of North America" by Irwin M. Brodo, Sylvia Duran Sharnoff, and Stephen Sharnoff. "Mosses Lichens & Ferns of Northwest North America" by Vitt et al. and "The Lichens of British Columbia" by Goward et al. are also useful for lichens, the former for beginners, and the latter for definitive technical information. Worldwide, a fifth of known fungal species are said to be lichenized, according to McCune & Geiser. In most cases the fungi are ascomycetes but some, including the common gilled species Omphalina ericetorum and the club-shaped Multiclavula mucida are basidiomycetes. The algae are usually green algae, but about 15% of the lichens in the Pacific Northwest are associated with the blue-green algae Nostoc and Scytonema which can fix nitrogen from the air into forms usable by plants and animals. Some lichens are associated with both green and blue-green algae. (McCune & Geiser). The blue green algae are less closely related to the green algae than they are to the bacteria and are often called cyanobacteria. (Kendrick 1992). The most common traditional use of wolf lichens is as a source of a bright yellow dye. Native Americans in California have used wolf lichens as an arrow poison, sometimes mixed with snake venom. They have also been used as an external medicine for sores, or even as an internal medicine for stomach disorders. (Brodo et al.). L. columbiana is common in subalpine forests, high plateaus and ridges to timberline, occasional in low elevation forests (McCune(1) for the Pacific Northwest).^ RANGE Lentaria columbiana is widespread throughout the Pacific Northwest but avoids the immediate coast (McCune). Distribution includes BC, WA, OR, ID, AB, CA, MT, and Mexico (Goward). 
FRUITING BODY  mostly 2-7(15)cm across, richly branched, branches solid or with loosely filled center, irregular in cross-section, often bearing brown cups; brilliant fluorescent yellow green or chartreuse, interior white; surface wrinkled, (McCune), almost always fertile, with dark brown cups up to 1.5cm across, fringed with spiny branchlets, black pycnidia often abundant, soredia and isidia absent, (Brodo)
HABITAT  bark or wood, rarely rock, (McCune), associated with the green alga Trebouxia (Brodo), especially on Larix lyallii, Pinus albicaulis, and Abies lasiocarpa, (Vitt)

ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  Nosema ceranae is presented as an example of the Phylum Microsporidia, The family should be Nosematidae which does not fit the format of the program. Microsporidia is a group of unicellular parasites of animals and protists with highly reduced mitochondria. (Hibbett et a. 2007). There are more than 1300 species and 170 genera. They are obligate parasites of all groups of animals, but most commonly infect insects, crustaceans, and fish. Some have complex life cycles with 2 or 3 hosts, and produce 2 or 3 kinds of spores. They are eukaryotic, spore-forming, parasitic organisms lacking flagellae and peroxisomes. "Spores of various shapes, with a usually coiled polar filament with layered internal structure, which during hatching is ejected and reorganized to an infection tube through which the infections cell (the sporoplasm) is injected into the host cell". (Kirk et al. 2008). Nosema cerranae affects the Asiatic honey bee and other bees. 97% of samples analyzed from bee colonies experiencing decline in 2005 in Spain were positive for this organism, but its exact role in the decline is unclear. Bees can die within 8 days of exposure. A WA State beekeeper familiar with N. ceranae in his own hives discounted it as being the cause of Colony Collapse Disorder. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosema_ceranae accessed December 25, 2009). Nosema apis infects bees as well, and Nosema bombycis is a parasite of silk worms. Nosema locustae has been studied for the control of locusts and grasshoppers. (Kirk et al. 2008). RANGE not specified

ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  Penicillium species are the so-called green molds and blue molds often encountered on foodstuffs in the refrigerator. Penicillium species also have well known uses in food production as well as medicine. Penicillium roqueforti is responsible for the flavor of Roquefort cheese, and Penicillium camemberti for that of Camembert cheese. Danish blue cheese and Italian Gorgonzola cheese are also ripened with Penicillium. The antibiotic penicillin was discovered after Penicillium contaminated Alexander Fleming's Staphylococcus culture in 1928. Penicillium chrysogenum is an important commercial source of the antibiotic. Penicillium griseofulvum is the source of another antibiotic, griseofulvin, used against fungal infections. Penicillium species are anamorphic fungi (see NOTES under Trichophyton species). The illustration shows two species on an orange: Penicillium digitatum (Pers.) Sacc. and Penicillium italicum Wehmer. These are common pathogens of citrus fruits, causing green mold and blue mold respectively. (Alexopoulos et al. 1996). RANGE widespread

LATIN NAMES  Phytophthora infestans  (Mont.) de Bary^  Trattato di knologia Ed. Sansoni Firenze 12: 240. 1876
ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  Phytophthora infestans is included as an example of Oomycota, one of the two fungal phyla of the Kingdom Chromista, as accepted by Ainsworth & Bisby's Dictionary of the Fungi 9th Edition. There are non-fungal phyla as well in Chromista. (Most fungi are in the Kingdom Eumycota). The nomenclature has changed so that Peronosporea replaces Oomycetes as the class. Phytophthora infestans is the cause of Late Blight of potato, which was unintentionally imported to Ireland and wiped out the Irish potato crop in the damp cool summers of 1845-1847, causing disastrous famine. It is estimated that Phytophthora infestans contributed to a million deaths, and drove millions to emigrate from Ireland. In most areas of the world, P. infestans appears to survive in the form of mycelium in infected tubers, which spread in the spring under certain conditions throughout the tissues of the new growth, and eventually produce zoosporangia on parts of the plants above ground. The German scientist de Bary described the life cycle and proved its role in the blight in two papers published in 1861 and 1863. According to Alexopoulos et al., his work contributed greatly to the death of the idea of spontaneous generation and to the acceptance of Louis Pasteur's germ theory of disease, published in 1863. Another member of this genus, Phytophthora ramosum, causes Sudden Oak Death in Tanoak (Notholithocarpus densiflorus), Coast Live Oak (Quercus agrifolia), and California Black Oak (Quercus kelloggii) in California and has been found in Oregon, (Mycena News, also www.suddenoakdeath.org). Other oomycetes include Pythium, the cause of a soil-borne disease called Damping off; Albugo candida, which causes white rust of crucifers such as cabbage; Peronospora tabacina, cause of blue mould of tobacco; and Plasmophora viticola, which causes downy mildew of grapes.

NOTES  Plasmodiophora brassicae is included as an example of the Phylum Plasmodiophoromycota in Kingdom Protozoa. The family has been changed to Plasmodiophoridae which does not fit the format of the program. All members of this group are obligate parasites. Although they may be studied by mycologists, members of this phylum would not be considered fungi according to Bryce Kendrick's definition of fungi: "Fungi are eukaryotic (their cells have nuclei), heterotrophic (they can't make their own food), osmotrophic (they absorb, don't digest, food), develop a rather diffuse, branched, tubular body (radiating hyphae making up mycelia or colonies), and reproduce by means of spores". P. brassicae produces zoospores with one nucleus and two flagellae that penetrate the root hairs of its host, the cabbage (Brassica oleracea). Inside, they grow into multinucleate but still microscopic primary plasmodia (which feed by ingestion). 'These eventually develop a wall and divide internally into uninucleate secondary sporangia. These germinate, releasing four secondary, biflagellate zoospores which leave the host. These may also act as gametes, fusing in pairs, but soon infect a root again, developing within host cells into multinucleate secondary plasmodia. At maturity, these can cleave into uninucleate cysts, each containing a single spore, which can persist in the soil for many years. This parasite stimulates the cabbage roots to become grossly swollen, a serious disease condition known as "club root".' RANGE widespread

NOTES  The exact taxonomic placement of this species is uncertain. It was first described as a protozoan, but by 1988 it was clear from DNA sequences that it is a fungus. (Alexopoulos et al. 1996). P. carinii is an important cause of pneumonia in the immunocompromised patient and is common in AIDS. It has a world-wide distribution among humans and has been detected in a variety of animals. Most healthy children have been exposed by 3-4 years old. (Braunwald et al. 2001). The life cycle has been described as follows. Uninucleate haploid cells occur in the lumen of the alveoli of the lung, and it is thought that they divide by fission. They also fuse in pairs. A wall develops around the diploid cells which is now an ascus. The nucleus divides into 8 nuclei that develop into spores. The spores are released when the ascus ruptures. (Alexopoulos et al.).

ENGLISH NAMES  rose mildew
NOTES  Podosphaera pannosa is included as an example of Erysiphales (powdery mildews). It is a very common powdery mildew in the northern hemisphere attacking roses, peaches, and apricots. (Lincoff 1981). Powdery mildews, caused by various species of fungi in the family Erysiphaceae, can affect trees, shrubs, roses, perennials, annuals, bulbous plants, vegetables, fruits, and many indoor plants: each species of powdery mildew affects only specific types of plant, but some plants are susceptible to more than one powdery mildew. Powdery mildews are particularly found when conditions are warm and dry during the day and cold at night, and on dry soils, and thus are often most severe at the end of the growing season. (Henry Doubleday Research Association). Powdery mildews are named because of their white powdery covering due to conidia (asexual spores). Note that downy mildews (Peronosporales in Oomycota) and dark mildews (Meliolales in Ascomycota) are different. RANGE widespread

ENGLISH NAMES  witch's broom rust
NOTES  Pucciniastrum included as an example of Uredinales (rust fungi). The rust fungi all grow on vascular plants, and often have very narrow host ranges. They do not have basidium producing fruitbodies, because basidia are produced from overwintering spores. There are up to five different types of spores specialized for different parts of the life cycle, and often two separate hosts that are taxonomically unrelated to each other. Pucciniastrum goeppertianum in BC has fir as one host (the aecial host) and as the other host (the telial host) various Vaccinium species (blueberry etc.). (various sources). The teliospores are produced on swollen infected blueberry shoots, and germinate on these shoots to produce basidiospores in late spring. The spores are carried by wind to fir trees where the current season's growth becomes infected. Aeciospores are then formed on needles and these are blown by wind to blueberry where they germinate on leaves and stem in mid to late summer. "The fungus eventually becomes systemic and perennial in the blueberry, stimulating the production of excessive lateral buds that develop into the characteristic broom-like masses of swollen shoots." Teliospores are formed on the swollen shoots and overwinter there. (Delbridge & Nickerson 1995).^ RANGE Pucciniastrum goeppertianum occurs in Canada in BC, AB, MB, NB, NF, NS, ON, PE, PQ, SK, YT, (Ginns).
FRUITING BODY  "Diseased blueberry plants has broomlike masses of swollen, spongy shoots with few or no leaves. The brooms usually begin to develop during the year following infection and then persist for many years, producing new infected growth each spring. Young shoots on the brooms are yellow-red at first, but later they become dark tan coloured and shiny. Eventually the epidermis becomes dull, dry and cracked. Infected plants do not usually produce fruit. On balsam fir, the disease causes yellowing and premature shedding of current season needles." (Delbridge)

ENGLISH NAMES  black bread mold
NOTES  This is included as an example of Subphylum Mucoromycotina of Phylum Zygomycota, one of the phyla of true fungi. The principal characteristic that distinguishes Class Zygomycetes is the production by most species of a thick-walled resting spore called a zygospore. The zygospore develops within a zygosporangium that is formed after fusion of structures containing sex cells (gametangia containing gametes). (Alexopoulos et al. 1996). Rhizopus stolonifer is a common fungus that forms mould on bread. It has a complicated life history. The sporangiospores of the fungus are released when the wall of the sporangium disintegrates. They develop into a fluffy, much-branched, white aerial mycelium, producing many aerial stolons [runners] that produce rhizoids [root-like structures] at certain points. New sporangiophores develop just above the rhizoids, with a vertical stem-like structure ending in an expansion (columella) that protrudes like a balloon into the lower part of the more or less spherical sporangium. The sporangium disintegrates to release sporangiospores and repeat the cycle. This is the asexual cycle, but there is also a sexual cycle that requires the union of hyphae of two distinct types, designated + and -. After union, a zygospore develops in a thick-walled black warty structure called a zygosporangium. The zygospore germinates and forms a sporangiophore that produces sporangiospores.

NOTES  This is included as an example of Subphylum Mucoromycotina of Phylum Zygomycota, one of the phyla of true fungi. The principal characteristic that distinguishes Class Zygomycetes is the production by most species of a thick-walled resting spore called a zygospore. The zygospore develops within a zygosporangium that is formed after fusion of structures containing sex cells (gametangia containing gametes). (Alexopoulos et al. 1996). During wet periods, the fruitbodies of gilled Mycena species are attacked by Spinellus fusiger, which produces tall slender fruiting stalks radiating from the cap. Each stalk ends in a tiny spherical spore ball, giving it a pinhead appearance. Infected caps have a striking hairy appearance. (Barron 1999). RANGE widespread, including BC, WA, CA

FAMILY  Anamorphic Fungi
LATIN NAMES  Sporothrix schenckii  Hektoen & C.F. Perkins^  Journal of Experimental Medicine 5: 80. 1900
ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  Sporothrix schenckii is a cosmopolitan species that causes sporotrichosis. The fungus enters the skin through a wound made, for instance, by a contaminated thorn. Once inside the host, the normally mycelial fungus becomes yeast-like. The initial localized infection may ulcerate, drain, and heal, but the infection may spread into the lymphatic system, forming secondary lesions. Eventually joints, bones, and internal organs may be affected. Sporothrix schenckii is an anamorphic fungus. It may be an anamorph of Ophiostoma in the ascomycete order Ophiostomatales. (Kendrick 1992). The commonest infections are on one limb in gardeners and florists, contracted from roses, sphagnum moss, and other plants. Secondary nodules in the proximal lymphatic system intermittently discharge small amounts of pus and may ulcerate. Spread beyond the limb initially affected is rare. The entry point for infection of joint, bone, lung, and other areas apart from the skin is unknown but is likely the lung. Treatment is with potassium iodide, azole drugs, or amphotericin B.

LATIN NAMES  Stachybotrys chartarum  (Ehrenb.) S. Hughes^  Can. J. Bot. 36. 812. 1958;  Stilbospora chartarum  Ehrenb.
ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  Stachybotrys chartarum is an anamorphic fungus (see NOTES under Trichophyton species). This fungus has achieved prominence because it grows commonly in homes in situations of flood or other water incursion, and produces macrocyclic trichothecenes, phenylspirodrimanes, cyclosporin, and other chemicals, which are injurious to the health of humans and other animals. Macrocyclic trichothecenes are potent inhibitors of protein synthesis; phenylspirodrimanes and cyclosporin are immune suppressants. A hemolysin might be involved in causing hemorrhage in some children, but this is controversial. The spores occur in the soil and are introduced along with floodwaters, or may be present on the dry surfaces of building materials. Moist conditions are required for growth, which appears as black patches that can be slightly shiny when fresh and powdery when dry. These surfaces may however be hidden from view. The fungus is relatively easy to identify because of the unique phialides of the genus and conidial morphology of the species. However, detection and remediation is best done by professionals as health injury could occur. Symptoms that have been reported include rash, irritation of mucous membranes, tightness of the chest, cough, pneumonia, bloody nasal discharge, fever, headache and fatigue. The symptoms dissipate when exposure is ended, but fatalities have been claimed. These symptoms can also be found with viral infections, so a combination of known exposure and suggestive symptoms would be needed to draw a link. Stachybotrys chartarum can be confirmed by microscopic examination or by other more specialized tests. (Nelson, Berlin D., 2001 Stachybotrys chartarum: The Toxic Indoor Mold). RANGE widespread

ENGLISH NAMES  peach leaf curl
NOTES  Taphrina deformans causes Peach Leaf Curl by attacking the leaves of peach trees and causing them to become thickened and distorted.^ T. deformans has 4 characteristics that make it unusual among the ascomycetes. 1) The assimilative mycelium is dikaryotic, unlike most ascomycetes. 2) An exposed layer of asci is produced on the surface of the host leaf, without surrounding or supporting fungal tissue. 3) The ascospores often bud in a rather yeast-like manner while still in the ascus. 4) When the asci dehisce, they tend to split across the tip, rather than around it, so they are atypical in the operculate group. (Kendrick).  "Ascospores are discharged in late spring or early summer; usually, they do not cause secondary infections but initiate the yeastlike saprophytic phase, producing blastospores by budding".  "Blastospores overwinter and cause infection the following spring." (Rossi). RANGE worldwide where peach trees occur
FRUITING BODY  "Peach leaf curl is a fungal disease affecting primarily the leaves and shoots. Fruit is occasionally attacked. Young leaves develop yellow to reddish discoloration and become thickened, crisp, and crinkled. Affected leaves are curled and deformed. A white powdery coating of the fungus later develops on infected leaves. Infected leaves either turn yellow and drop or remain on the tree, turning dark brown as the season progresses. Infected green shoots become thickened and distorted. Fruits may show swollen, reddish areas on the surface. These areas lack the normal peach fuzz. The fungus overwinters on twigs and buds. This disease is a major problem of peaches in western Washington. Severe leaf drop affects fruit production, reduces vigor of trees, and increases susceptibility to winter injury." (Hortense)

NAME ORIGIN  means 'deforming'
SIMILAR  The disease cycle of Taphrina communis (plum pockets) is similar to that of Taphrina deformans, and occurs particularly on plum trees. "Plum pockets is a fungal disease affecting fruit, twigs, and leaves. Infected fruit initially develop small, white spots which rapidly enlarge. The spots later turn reddish to velvety gray. The fruit become distorted, discolored, and much larger than normal. Pits may be absent in the spongy, bladderlike, dark brown fruit. The leathery skin may later become covered with a whitish coating of fungal spores. The fruit later turn dry and hard (mummified). Leaves and twigs show symptoms similar to those of peach leaf curl. Leaves and shoots may be discolored (reddish to yellow) and curled or twisted. The fungus can overwinter on twigs, bud scales, and infected fruit.", (Hortense(1))

Taphrina populi-salicis Mix causes golden yellow leaf spots on cottonwood and willow in British Columbia (Allen) and is found in Oregon and California as well (collections at NYBG). "Taphrina may live saprophytically in a yeast-like phase, overwintering on dormant bark and buds. Spores from the yeast phase are spread by wind and rain during the spring after bud break, when they infect young leaves before the cuticles has hardened." (Callan from Mix 1949). The first signs of infection are swollen, cupped, round to oval blisters, 0.5-several centimeters across on leaves in spring.

NOTES  Anamorphic Fungi. Tilachlidium brachiatum is a parasite on decomposed gilled mushrooms and occurs also on Trametes, Helvella crispa, and presumably other fungi. It forms anamorphic fruitbodies called synnemata (singular synnema) that are formed of whitish bundles of long, parallel conidiophores, the bundles often very compact. It is sometimes difficult to determine the host which may be very decomposed.^ The teleomorph is Pseudonectria tilachlidii. There is a question of whether Tilachlidium brachiatum grows on insects, but Petch(2) (p.66-67) raises the possibility that it is growing in those cases on other fungi that are parasitic on the insect. The description here is derived from Mycoquebec(1) except where noted. RANGE The accompanying photographs were taken in WA, but it occurs more widely in North America and Europe.

FAMILY  Anamorphic Fungi
LATIN NAMES  Trichophyton species^
ENGLISH NAMES  superficial dermatophytosis, athlete's foot, tinea, ringworm
NOTES  Trichophyton species are anamorphic fungi (sometimes called mitosporic fungi, deuteromycetes, imperfect fungi or asexual fungi). This indicates either that they do not have a known sexual life cycle or that they are "anamorphs" or asexual forms of a fungus having another named form that does have a sexual life cycle (called the "teleomorph"). Trichophyton has 24 species and varieties, and 8 of the species have known teleomorphs in Arthroderma (in the ascomycete order Onygenales). (Kendrick 1992). Trichophyton species (or Microsporum or Epidermophyton species) cause superficial dermatophytosis on human skin, the most common of which is tinea pedis (athlete's foot). The fungus may affect bare skin as tinea corporis (ringworm), the groin as tinea cruris (jock itch), or the scalp as tinea capitis (mainly in children). The toenails may also become infected and deformed or crumbly (onychomycosis). The name ringworm comes from the ring-like, winding, or wavy form of the affected skin. Azole creams normally cure uncomplicated athlete's foot or ringworm on bare skin, but nail infections usually require prolonged oral medication. (Braunwald et al. 2001). RANGE widespread

LATIN NAMES  Ustilago maydis  (DC.) Corda^  Icon. fung. (Prague) 5: 3. 1842
ENGLISH NAMES  corn smut
NOTES  Ustilago maydis is included as an example of the smut fungi in the Class Ustilagomycetes. The young tumors have a sugary aromatic white pulp, sought after by some, and canned and sold as a delicacy in Mexico; however, if spores come into contact with food it is reported to cause disorders similar to the ergotism associated with Claviceps purpurea. RANGE not specified
FRUITING BODY  attacks the aerial parts of the plans and occasionally the roots, producing irregular swellings or tumors that can reach 15-20cm across, particularly large on the cob; at first white then wine-red and finally deep black, at maturity "surface is papyruslike and fragile while the completely black inside is formed by a powdery spore mass"^, (Lincoff), irregular silvery galls, may form on any part of corn (maize) plants, replacing kernels in distorted ears of corn, filled with black spore powder when mature beneath a very thin fragile outer layer, (McKnight)

FAMILY  Valsaceae, Order Diaporthales, Class Sordariomycetes, Phylum Ascomycota
LATIN NAMES  Valsa sordida  Nitschke^  Pyrenomyc. Germ. 2: 203. 1870;  Cytospora chrysosperma  (Pers.) Fr.
ENGLISH NAMES  Cytospora canker
NOTES  The most conspicuous feature to the untrained eye is the long, orange-red, coiled tendrils consisting of sticky masses of conidia (asexual spores). The associated disease, Cytospora canker, is rarely a problem of economic importance in natural tree stands, causing disease when trees or branches are unhealthy or stressed, "but can cause serious damage in forest nurseries, young plantations, and in horticultural settings".^ The description here is derived from Allen(1). Valsa sordida is the teleomorph name associated with the anamorph Cytospora chrysosperma which has been reduced to a synonym based on the rule that one name should be used for teleomorph and anamorph when the relationship is clear. Other Cytospora canker diseases include Cytospora canker of stone fruits, caused by Cytospora leucostoma or Cytospora cincta. RANGE Valsa sordida is widely distributed in the range of its hosts in BC, and common throughout the northern hemisphere and Australia.
FRUITING BODY  The Cytospora canker disease "occurs on stems, branches, and twigs, forming elongate cankers, regular or irregular in outline, generally with defined borders". "Cankers appear as discoloured sunken zones, with a slightly raised perimeter formed by annual callus growth. The inner bark of diseased tissue turns brown to black and may have a distinct foul odour. The sapwood associated with cankers is light to reddish brown. Several years after infection, dead bark lifts away from the stem and falls off. Fruiting bodies (pycnidial stromata) of the asexual stage of the fungus (Cytospora) form within the cankers, just beneath the cuticle of the dead bark", appearing as short gray-black cones, 0.05-0.01cm in diameter. "Sticky masses of conidia ooze out of the pycnidia" forming the long, orange-red, coiled tendrils. Perithecia of the sexual stage (Valsa) are more rare. "They appear as spherical black structures beneath the bark in clusters of 6-12", each about 0.05cm in diameter. 
HABITAT  in BC reported on maple, cottonwood, Trembling Aspen, Lombardy Poplar, and willow; elsewhere in North America also on Paper Birch, Water Birch, White Poplar, oak, apple, chokecherry, elderberry, and mountain-ash
MICROSCOPIC  ascospores 7-12 x 1.5-2.5 microns, allantoid with both ends rounded, colorless, unicellular^; asci 8-spored, 30-45 x 5-7 microns, clavate, with an apical ring; conidia 3-5 x 1-1.5 microns, allantoid, colorless, unicellular, "often emerging in long orange tendrils"; conidiophores 10-40 mm long, usually branched, colorless, phialidic.

FAMILY  Venturiaceae, Order Venturiales, Class Dothideomycetes, Phylum Ascomycota
LATIN NAMES  Venturia inaequalis  (Cooke) G. Winter^  in Thuemen, Mycoth. Univ., cent. 3: no. 261. 1875
ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  Venturia inaequalis causes apple scab disease.^ According to Volk(2) "these apples are perfectly good for eating, tasting exactly the same and with the same texture as uninfected apples, without any toxin production at all". Despite this, the disease is an economic problem because yields are also reduced and up to 70% of a crop may be lost. Sometimes leaves and other parts of the tree may fall off. Volk(2) described the life cycle, "The ascospores may infect the young leaves or the very young ovary in the flower, penetrating the cuticle. The infection remains outside the epidermis, eventually forming conidia (asexual spores) that push up the cuticle. The conidia are blown about by the wind, where they can infect new leaves and developing fruits. The cycle may be repeated throughout the summer, as long as conditions remain moist. Thus this infection cycle is said to be polycyclic. As winter approaches, the infected leaves fall to the ground. In the moister conditions near the ground, the mycelium of the fungus grows through the leaf. Any leaf that has been infected by more than one mating type of the fungus can be a site for sexual reproduction. V. inaequalis belongs to the Ascomycota; in this case asci are produced in pseudothecia (=pseudoperithecia)"... "These ascospores are thick-walled, thus enabling the fungus to survive the winter. In the spring the ascospores are shed and can infect the newly developing parts of the plant, continuing the cycle." RANGE widespread
FRUITING BODY  "The symptomatic spots are most noticeable on leaves and  fruit. Infections first appear as olive-green spots with indefinite borders. With age, these spots become more prominent and darken to greenish-black with a velvety appearance". "Severe spotting will cause leaves to senesce and fall off. Spots on young fruit result in deformation and cracking". "If infection is severe, the fruit may drop off before ripening. Defoliation may result in a reduction of flower bud formation so that bloom or fruit yield the next year will be reduced.", (Cornell) 
HABITAT  occurs wherever apples are grown and can occur also on crabapple and mountain ash (Cornell)
MICROSCOPIC  ascospores 11-15 x 5-7 microns, 2-celled, with the cells unequal in size in a characteristic footprint shape^; asci produced in pseudothecia; conidia 12-22 x 6-12 microns, "single-celled, uninucleate, brown or olive in mass but lighter when viewed individually under a microscope, and are narrower at one end than the other", (Vaillancourt)
NAME ORIGIN  refers to the ascospores which are two-celled, with the cells being unequal in size

FAMILY  Uncertain, Order Tremellales, Class Tremellomycetes, Phylum Basidiomycota
LATIN NAMES  Xenolachne flagellifera  D.P. Rogers^  Mycologia 39: 562. 1947
ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  Xenolachne flagellifera is tiny and unlikely to be encountered, but is of intrinsic interest due to its long slender sterigmata. Dictionary of the Fungi Ninth Edition placed Xenolachne in the Sirobasidiaceae, but Rogers says "it is clearly foreign to the Sirobasidiaceae", and Kenneth Wells places it in Tremellaceae. Dictionary of the Fungi Tenth Edition places it in Tremellales without specifying a family.^ RANGE It was found in OR and MA, and is known only from the type specimens, (Ginns).
FRUITING BODY  microscopic, an almost imperceptible white fuzz, under 40x appearing as a "delicate, glistening, snow-white pile or nap composed of very slender threads tipped by minute swellings, collapsing on drying", (Rogers)
HABITAT  parasitic on the spore-bearing surface of Hyaloscypha atomaria (a tiny ascomycete), growing on the lower side of damp logs of Libocedrus decurrens, Pinus strobus, and Pseudotsuga menziesii
MICROSCOPIC  spores 5.5-8 x 2.5-3.5 microns, oblong-cylindric, borne symmetrically on the sterigmata, without apiculus, tipped by the end of the sterigma, germinating by repetition or by a clamp-bearing mycelium^; basidia subtended by proliferating clamp connections, hypobasidia 7.5-10 x 5-6 microns elongate-ovate or elongate-ellipsoid, or rarely up to 20 microns long and subfusiform, "with one longitudinal septum, bearing two subcylindric or tapering epibasidia 2-3 microns in diameter and about 10 microns long, each more or less abruptly attenuated to a capillary flagelliform sterigma under 0.2 microns in diameter, up to 35 microns long"; hyphae 2 microns wide, distinct, not gelatinized, with clamp connections throughout
