ENGLISH NAMES  barometer earthstar, water-measure earthstar, hygroscopic earthstar, barometer earthstar
NOTES  {See also Earthstars Table.} Astraeus hygrometricus group represents a hygroscopic earthstar that closes in dry weather but opens in wet weather so that the star-like pointed rays of the outer layer curl out and underneath the spore case. Features include 6-15 rays, papery whitish to grayish or brownish spore case that ruptures through a poorly defined apical pore or slit, a spore mass that is white at first, brown to cocoa brown when mature, sometimes black rhizomorphs, and round finely warted spores.^ Phosri(1) recognized that several species have been known under this name and as a result of molecular study described 3 new species, Astraeus morganii (similar to Astraeus pteridis), Astraeus telleriae (from Europe), and Astraeus smithii Watling, M.P. Martin & Phosri. Astraeus smithii was confirmed by molecular methods from Michigan and Wisconsin and could be the correct name for the Pacific Northwest species usually called Astraeus hygrometricus [our conclusion]. The distribution is given as central and northern United States. Phosri(1) say it is "characterised by the inner peridium at maturity becoming matted-fibrillose to reticulate, the dark almost blackish rhizoids, and its unique ITS nrDNA". The description is included below. A. Ceska says that he once heard a radio interview with a Czech amateur mycologist reporting the blue color of Astraeus hygrometricus lasting for about three hours after opening of the fruiting body. RANGE Astraeus 'hygrometricus' sensu auct. mult. found at least in BC (in Redhead(5)), OR (Zeller(2)), AZ, CA, and worldwide in distribution, (Arora), known throughout the United States, and previously reported from AZ, CA, CO, CT, FL, GA, IL, MD, MA, MI, MN, NM, NY, PA, SC, TN, TX, WA, Australia, Canada, Europe, India, Mexico and United Kingdom, (Bates), Oregon State University has collections from OR, AZ, CA, MD, OH, Japan. The Pacific Forestry Centre has collections from BC, and the University of British Columbia has collections from FL, MI, NM, and Japan. Not all of these records would correspond to the Pacific Northwest species.

ENGLISH NAMES  desert drumstick, flatcap stalked puffball, scaly-stalked puffball, sandy stiltball
NOTES  Battarrea phalloides develops deep underground, enclosed by volva that is broken as the long shaggy stem elongates, leaving a sac-like volva on base, and bearing the whitish spore case aloft where it ruptures peripherally. The top falls off, and the lower half (concave downward), is covered with a rusty brown sticky-powdery spore mass that is gradually dispersed. It grows in arid areas after rains. Spores are round and warted, and there is capillitium of two types: simple short hyphae, and elongated cells with internal spirals.^ Miller(14) differentiates Battarrea stevenii by saying that Battarrea phalloides is reputed to have a gelatinous tissue in the volva (Miller(14)), but there is molecular evidence of the synonymy of B. stevenii with B. phalloides, (Martin, M.P.). The online Species Fungorum, accessed February 7, 2017, gave the current name of B. stevenii as B. phalloides but MycoBank, accessed the same day, gave the current name of B. stevenii as B. stevenii. Siegel(2) say that recent genetic studies have shown that several species go by the name Battarrea phalloides. RANGE B. phalloides occurs worldwide but it is rare. It has been reported from BC, YT, AZ, and Australia, (Schalkwijk-Barendsen), ID (Smith), AK, and CA, (Arora), Mexico (Esqueda(1)), and Austria, France, Hungary, Italy, Spain, and Burundi, (Martin, M.P.). Oregon State University has a collection from OR, and the Pacific Forestry Centre has collections from BC. It also occurs in WA (M. Beug, pers. comm.), and the Owyhee region of both OR and ID (Trueblood(1)). The National Mycological Herbarium in Ottawa has collections from AB.

Demoulin & Rebriev with the same Bulliard name as an obligate synonym. The online Index Fungorum, accessed the same day, showed even more inconsistencies but appeared to favor Bovistella utriformis (Bull.) Demoulin & Rebriev, with Calvatia utriformis (Bull.) Jaap and Lycoperdon utriforme Bull.  Hist. Champ. Fr. (Paris): 153 (1791) as two of the synonyms. Calvatia bovista was synonymized with Calvatia utriformis (Bull.: Pers.) Jaap in Breitenbach(2). It was synonymized with Handkea utriformis (Bull.: Pers.) Kreisel in 1989 (along with C. tatrensis sensu Zeller & A.H. Sm. as a variety and C. tatrensis var. gruberi as another variety) but this genus not accepted by Demoulin according to Dictionary of the Fungi Ninth Edition. The description is derived from Zeller(13) except where indicated. RANGE Collections were examined from ID, CA, MI, and ND and distribution is throughout the United States and southern Canada, (Zeller).

NAME ORIGIN  means 'near [Calvatia] sculpta'
SIMILAR  Calvatia sculpta has longer, sharper spines (up to 2.5cm long), but is distinguished most reliably from Calbovista subsculpta microscopically by the different capillitium, (Ammirati). C. sculpta has different capillitium and spores, as well as a spore mass that is not as dark, (Morse).

NAME ORIGIN  after Dr. William Judson Boone, first president of the College of Idaho, who was keenly interested in the central Rocky Mountain mushroom flora, and who had some beautiful specimens of this species that A.H. Smith saw in 1935^, (Zeller(13))
SIMILAR  Calvatia gigantea is smooth nearly to maturity, and the capillitium has isodiametric pits that are often abundant, (Zeller). C. gigantea is smooth, like fine kid leather, before breaking into flat plates, (Ammirati). C. gigantea 1) is spherical to nearly spherical, rather than depressed spherical, 2) has a cord-like rhizomorph whereas C. booniana does not [but Zeller(13) disagrees], 3) has an exoperidium that is thin and fragile rather than thick and breaking up in raised polygons, and 4) grows in brushy or grassy bottomlands rather than in arid lands under sagebrush and juniper, (Ramsey). Arora gives an account of a giant puffball from California that does not seem to fit either C. booniana or C. gigantea: the former wartier and broader and the latter being smoother and whiter, (Arora).

LATIN NAMES  Calvatia cyathiformis  (Bosc) Morgan^  J. Cincinnati Soc. Nat. Hist. 12(4): 168. 1890
ENGLISH NAMES  purple-spored puffball, vase puffball
NOTES  Calvatia cyathiformis is distinguished from other large puffballs by the spore mass that becomes purple and by the distinct, typically well-developed sterile base. However, if Calvatia fragilis is considered a synonym of Calvatia cyathiformis (see more details below on that question), the Calvatia fragilis description should be consulted as well since it represents the more common variation and the sterile base is inconspicuous. Other features of Calvatia cyathiformis include 1) a spherical to top-shaped or pear-shaped fruitbody, 2) a thin exoperidium (outer layer) that is white to pale brown and smooth or floccose, slightly scaly, often cracking into broad patches in its upper part, 3) an endoperidium (inner layer) that is thin and purplish, both layers flaking off, 4) a spore mass that becomes deep purplish brown, and 5) spiny spores.^ |Jarvis(1) wrote in 2014, 'Calvatia cyathiformis and Calvatia fragilis are two very closely related species, possibly even the same species. Bates (2004) showed in phylogenetic analysis that they form a well-supported monophyletic sister group. They have similar morphological features, except for three main differences: 1) overall size; 2) subgleba size and shape; and 3) subgleba cellular density. Calvatia cyathiformis has a very large and broadly bulbous to clavate-shaped subgleba that is arguably a true pseudostipe, whereas C. fragilis has a narrow reduced subgleba that is more tapered at the end, rooting it into the ground, and not acting as a true pseudostipe. The former will grow up to 80-130 mm tall x 70-130 mm broad, while C. fragilis is almost half the size, 35-60 mm tall x 40-70 broad. Calvatia fragilis has subgleba tissue with smaller chambers and a more compact appearance than Calvatia cyathiformis. Historically Calvatia cyathiformis and Calvatia fragilis have been listed as a forma and as a variety of Calvatia cyathiformis; Calvatia cyathiformis forma/var. cyathiformis and as Calvatia cyathiformis forma/var. fragilis. DNA sequence analysis confirms that they are sister to each other, but with careful examination, the morphology shows that they can be recognized as distinct species (Kreisel 1992, Bates 2004). One specimen in the UC Berkeley herbarium (UCB506673, RP Brandt 1913) was labeled as “Fungi of California,” without any location or habitat data. This specimen is clearly of C. cyathiformis, with a robust pseudostipe up to three inches long. Therefore it could be possible that C. cyathiformis has been collected in California, but very rarely.' |She also wrote, "The two species Calvatia fragilis and Calvatia cyathiformis have been treated as different species in previous works (Kreisel 1992, Bates 2004). The evidence from multiple collections from California reveals that Calvatia fragilis is distinctly different than Calvatia cyathiformis. In addition, the molecular data shows that these two are different." (Jarvis(1), with Latin names italicized). |Zeller was inclined to recognize Clavaria fragilis as a species (Zeller(3)), note in Zeller(13), but in finishing her work on Calvatia after her death A.H. Sm. reduced C. fragilis to C. cyathiformis forma fragilis (Vitt.) A.H. Sm. (Zeller(13)). Not all authors agree that they are separate species, and both Cyathus fragilis (Quel.) Morgan and Lycoperdon fragile (Vitt.) were considered synonyms of Calvatia cyathiformis (Bosc.) Morgan in the online Species Fungorum, accessed April 1, 2018. MycoBank listed them as separate species on the same date. |RANGE It is possible that some records of Calvatia cyathiformis are really Calvatia fragilis if the two are separate species, particularly because C. fragilis has been regarded as C. cyathiformis forma fragilis (Quel.) A.H. Sm. and as a synonym. Calvatia cyathiformis was found at least in OR, OH, MO, and TX, (Zeller(3)), and WA, ID, CA, MI, ND, OK, PA, and WV, (Zeller(13)). It is found in AZ, and is common in many parts of the United States, being previously reported from CA, ID, MI, ND, OK, PA, TZ, WA, and WV, as well as being reported from Africa, China, Japan and South America, (Bates). It has been reported from North America, Central America, South America, tropical Africa, tropical Asia, and Japan, (Kreisel).

STEM  shows tremendous variation in the degree of development of the sterile base: fruitbody tapering abruptly into well-developed thick stout rooting base, often sulcate [grooved] to deeply wrinkled from the base up to the broadest dimension; sterile base "chambered, remaining intact as a persistent dark cup-like structure which may remain in place over winter"^, (Zeller(13)), sterile base chambered, white to dingy yellow or darker, persisting as a deep purplish to purple-brown cup-like structure after spores are gone, (Arora)

NAME ORIGIN  means 'cup-shaped'
SIMILAR  Calvatia fragilis has an inconspicuous sterile base, but the degree of development is variable in both species, one reason for regarding C. fragilis as a form of C. cyathiformis, (Zeller(13)). Calvatia rubrotincta has a peridium that becomes spotted with red, and the spores are strongly verrucose and russet in Melzer's reagent, (Zeller(13)).

For specific discussion on the synonymy, see the NOTES section of Calvatia cyathiformis. Gastropila fragilis is based on a different type, Mycenastrum fragilis Lev. RANGE McKnight(1) says Calvatia fragilis is widespread and often common in grasslands of the Great Plains and in the Rocky Mountains. It was reported according to Zeller(3) from OR, ON, IL, TX, and WY. Collections were examined from ID, AL, CA, LA, MI, NM, OK, SD, TX, UT, WY, with distribution "generally throughout the United States and southern Canada", (Zeller(13)). It was examined from AZ, common in many parts of the United States, and previously reported from ID, LA, MI, NM, OK, TX, UT, and WY, also reported from Africa, central Asia, Australia, Southern Europe, and New Zealand, (Bates). It is Known from many parts of the United States, and previously reported from OR, ID, AZ, CA, CO, GA, TN, and WY, (Jarvis).

ENGLISH NAMES  giant puffball
NOTES  Features of Calvatia gigantea are 1) very large, spherical or nearly spherical fruitbody, 2) outer covering thin and white or grayish (but changing to yellowish and becoming olivaceous), smooth like kid leather for a time before breaking up and falling away in pieces, 3) a thin, fragile inner layer, 4) a spore mass that is white becoming yellowish or greenish, 5) absent or almost absent sterile base but attachment to the ground by a cord, 6) growth in low ground under brush, along ditches, in pastures, and in woods, and 7) round to nearly round minutely ornamented or smooth spores.^ The description is derived from Zeller(13) except where indicated. RANGE Calvatia gigantea "occurs throughout eastern North America and into the Prairie States, but reports from the Pacific Coast all need further verification", (Zeller). It has been reported from British Columbia, (in Redhead), but might be confused with Calvatia booniana. It is found east of the Cascades in WA, OR, ID, (Ramsey, who differentiates C. booniana).
CHEMICAL REACTIONS  
OUTER SURFACE  very large, 20-50cm across, nearly spherical, depressed-spherical or obovate; outer layer "white or grayish but changing to yellowish and becoming olivaceous, at first subtomentose, smooth like a kid glove", very thin (about 0.1cm when dry), fragile, finally breaking up and falling away in pieces^, (Zeller), smooth, finely velvety, deerskin-like, somewhat reticulate in places, (Breitenbach), 10-80cm (Buczacki)
INNER LAYER  thin, fragile, "after maturity gradually breaking up into fragments and falling away"
SPORE MASS  "white, then yellowish and finally olivaceous or greenish yellow"^, (Zeller), white at first, firm, then olive, then olive-brown, powdery, (Buczacki)
STEM  subgleba [sterile base] very shallow or almost absent; with a thick cord-like root
ODOR  none when young, fetid when old^, (Miller)
TASTE  mild and pleasant^ (Miller)
EDIBILITY  edible [when young] and choice, (Lincoff), edible when young and white all the way through, (Smith)
HABITAT  single or gregarious "on low ground under brush and often bordering woodland pools, sometimes abundant along drainage ditches, late summer and early fall"^, (Zeller), occurs in brushy areas, woods, pastures and occasionally in urban surrounding, during late spring, summer, or fall, (Ammirati)
SPORE DEPOSIT  
MICROSCOPIC  spores 3.3-5.5 x 3-5 microns, round to nearly round, rarely very broadly elliptic, "minutely and sparsely spiny-punctate to seemingly smooth", yellowish to tawny in Melzer's reagent, yellowish to pale olive-brown in KOH, often with one droplet, pedicel small^; capillitial threads 2.2-8.8 microns wide, "elongate, occasionally branched, branches Y-shaped or otherwise, becoming attenuated to the slender pointed tips, septate", "septa abundant to occasional, threads of even diameter at septa or enlarged slightly causing a joint-like appearance", "walls up to 1.5 microns thick, pitted, the pits round and often abundant, frequently widest on the interior side or not completely penetrating the wall", wall yellowish in KOH and Melzer's reagent, (Zeller), spores finely verrucose, sometimes almost smooth, sometimes containing droplets; basidia 4-spored, 25-35 x 5-6 microns; capillitial threads occasionally with small pores, (Breitenbach), capillitial walls thick with round pits (McKnight)
NAME ORIGIN  means 'large, gigantic'
SIMILAR  Calvatia booniana is coarsely areolate squamulose, the polygons and cones up to 2cm high at times, and the capillitium is pitted very occasionally, the pits often not extending clear through the wall, (Zeller). C. booniana has an outer surface composed of large flat warts or scales and breaking into polygonal plates, whereas C. gigantea has smooth surface for a time before breaking into plates, (Ammirati). C. booniana 1) is depressed spherical rather than spherical to nearly spherical, 2) lacks a cord-like rhizomorph [Zeller(13) disagrees], 3) has a thick exoperidium that breaks up in raised polygons, rather than a thin fragile one, and 4) grows in arid lands under sagebrush and juniper, rather than in brushy or grassy bottomlands, (Ramsey). Arora gives an account of a giant puffball from California that does not seem to fit either C. booniana or C. gigantea: the former wartier and broader and the latter being smoother and whiter, (Arora). Calvatia bovista (C. utriformis) can be confused with small fruitbodies of C. gigantea, but the latter has a smooth velvety surface, and lacks the constricted stem-like base, (Breitenbach).

SIMILAR  Calvatia cyathiformis is close: Zeller and Smith comment, "More data are needed to determine whether the red spots of the type collection represent a true color change or are the result of a bacterial infection. The spores in Melzer's sol., however, are darker than those of C. cyathiformis and this should be a reliable species distinction", (Zeller(13)).

Sm. include 1) medium size, 2) white to cream surface that cracks into low irregular granular-furfuraceous plaques, falling away to reveal inner layer, 3) firm to papery inner layer that splits irregularly (sometimes forming a tattered mouth), 4) mature spore mass powdery and chocolate brown to dark olivaceous brown, 5) pleated sterile base (occupying lower quarter of the fruitbody) with purplish chamber walls, 6) weakly ornamented nearly round spores, and 7) capillitium with slit-like pits.^ Calvatia tatrensis var. gruberi A.H. Sm. was described from OR in 1964 with larger size (about 13.5cm across), lack of pleating at base, and heavier ornamentation on outer surface, (Zeller(13)).

(Calvatia tatrensis Hollos sensu Zeller & A.H. Sm. was synonymized with Handkea utriformis (Bull.: Pers.) Kreisel var. hungarica (Hollos) Kreisel and C. tatrensis Hollos var. gruberi was synonymized with Handkea utriformis (Bull.: Fr.) Kreisel var. gruberi (A.H. Sm.) Kreisel.) Kreisel synonymized Calvatia tatrensis Hollos sensu Hollos with Calvatia cretacea (Berk.) C.G. Lloyd, but the original name was retained in the online Species Fungorum, accessed January 21, 2015, along with var. gruberi. If Kreisel's synonymy for the species in the sense of Zeller and A.H. Sm. is current, the current name according to the online Species Fungorum, accessed January 21, 2015 would be Lycoperdon utriforme Bull. RANGE Collections of Calvatia tatrensis Hollos sensu Zeller & A.H. Sm. were examined from WY, UT, (Zeller(13)(1964)). It was reported from OR by (Zeller(8)(1941)) but this collection was not mentioned in 1964. Although Calvatia tatrensis in this sense could be considered Lycoperdon utriforme, the collection of Calvatia tatrensis var. gruberi from OR would still fall under Calvatia tatrensis.

A variety idahoensis A.H. Sm. in Zeller & Smith Lloydia 27: 156. 1964 (differing "in the more yellow brown gleba as dried, in the isodiametric to irregular shape of the pits, and the more frequent branching of the capillitial threads") is not accepted by Kreisel on the basis that its capillitium has isodiametric to irregular, not with slit-like pits. RANGE Collections of C. fumosa var. fumosa (here considered Gastropila fumosa) were examined from WA, OR, ID, WY, (Zeller(13)), and CA (Zeller(3)). It is common in the western United States (Arora).

SIMILAR  Geastrum floriforme has a peristome that is not distinctly delimited, the outermost mycelial layer of the rays bind debris, and spores are larger, (Pegler(4)). G. floriforme is also hygroscopic and small: it has a whitish rather than brownish spore case, and a poorly formed peristome with radiating lines but no grooves and no well-defined area around it, (Ramsey(1)). G. floriforme is differentiated in a key on basis of the peristome not being sulcate (present merely as a puncture or slit), and the spore size given is also smaller for G. floriforme, (Smith(4)).

SIMILAR  Geastrum corollinum has "a comparatively well-delimited peristome, a mycelial layer which does not bind debris, and smaller spores", (Pegler(4)). G. corollinum (as G. recolligens) is also small and hygroscopic, but spore case is brown rather than whitish and peristome is lacerate / fimbriate, (Ramsey). G. corollinum (as G. recolligens) is differentiated in key on the basis that peristome is lacerate / radially fimbriate, while peristome of G. floriforme is "not sulcate (present merely as a puncture or slit)", (Smith(4)).

NOTES  Features include 1) size 6cm or more across when the outer covering of the fruitbody has expanded out into star-like rays leaving the exterior of the rays clean, 2) non-hygroscopic rays, 3) dark wood brown to light drab spore case on short pallid stem, 4) opening by a distinct cone-shaped peristome that is often paler than the rest of the spore case, and 5) spores that are round and warty.^ Geastrum limbatum Fr. is regarded as a synonym of Geastrum coronatum Pers. by Pegler(4), but to simplify the issues, that concept is described separately. The four descriptions here refer to Geastrum limbatum Fr. sensu Bresadola - those of Coker(3) and Smith(49) are specifically named that way, with Smith(49) referring to the Coker(3) concept, and those of Ramsey(1) and Smith(4) appear to depend on Smith(49), (although Smith(4) uses the authority Geastrum limbatum Jungh.). Smith(49) specifically says that he is not following the concept of Cunningham. Coker is trying to refine the concept because of finding many American herbarium specimens labeled G. limbatum that would better be referred to G. rufescens, G. triplex, or G. pectinatum. He is also distinguishing it from G. limbatus of Hollos and of Massee and Berkeley in Europe that looks like Geastrum rufescens except for a blackish and more bald spore case with a more definite mouth. RANGE G. limbatum was found on range lands in ID, (Ramsey), and is rare in the central and southern US, (Smith(4)). One University of British Columbia collection from BC was collected by T. McIntosh (determined as G. limbatum by A. McKinnon), another UBC collection from BC was collected by V.J. Krajina (determined by R. Bandoni), and a third UBC collection from NM was determined by W.H. Long. They should be compared with the features of Geastrum coronatum Pers. as described here.

NAME ORIGIN  means 'bordered'
SIMILAR  Geastrum limbatum resembles Geastrum triplex "in most important characters" - it differs from G. triplex "in the splitting away of the outer layer over the central region and the arching up of the middle layer", (Coker(3)). Geastrum fornicatum lacks the definite mouth area, (Smith(49)). Geastrum quadrifidum also has non-hygroscopic rays and a spore case that has pedicel and distinct peristome, but the fruitbody is smaller, the outer layer of the rays is covered with dense coat of white mycelium and debris, and the peristome is not paler than the rest of the spore case, (Ramsey, but note Smith says specifically mouth area of spore case of G. quadrifidum is paler than the remainder of the case). Geastrum rufescens has vinaceous colors and the outer layer does not separate the same way as the rays expand, (Smith(49)). G. rufescens also has the spore case on a pedicel but the apical pore is not sharply delimited.

ENGLISH NAMES  four-rayed earthstar, rayed earthstar
NOTES  {See also Earthstars Table.} Features include 1) small size, up to 3.7cm across when the outer covering of the fruitbody has expanded out into rays, 2) 4-5(8) star-like rays that are not hygroscopic, but raise the spore case as if on stilts still attached at their tips to a nest-like remnant in the ground formed from the outermost layer of the rays (i.e. fornicate), 3) hoary spore case on a short stalk, opening by a distinct cone-shaped peristome outlined by a distinct raised rim, 4) dark brown mature spore mass, and 5) round spores^. Confusion has resulted because Geastrum coronatum (Schaeff.) J. Schroet. and Lycoperdon coronatum Scop. are said to be synonyms, but not Geastrum coronatum Pers. According to Bates(1), Geastrum coronatum in the sense of Lloyd(1902) and subsequent American authors and in the illustrations of G. coronatum (Schaeff.) J. Schroet. in Coker(3) is Geastrum quadrifidum as used by Pegler(4) and Bates(1). As an addendum for those particularly interested, what Smith(49) described as Geastrum coronatum Pers. (used here for a separate species) is probably also Geastrum quadrifidum Pers., and its description is included here. A.H. Smith says in Smith(4) in describing G. quadrifidum Pers. that it was generally known under the name G. coronatum in the older literature, and the Smith(4) description of G. quadrifidum Pers. corresponds more or less to the Smith(49) description as G. coronatum Pers. (see G. quadrifidum). Here is the summary of features of G. coronatum Pers. in Smith(49), corresponding instead to this species: "a very easy species to recognize because of the copious white mycelial coating of unopened fructifications, the peculiar sheen over the dark pedicellate spore sac with its basal collar, the fibrillose mouth delimited by a distinct pale circle, and the manner in which the fructification typically stands up on the points of the rays when fully expanded" (Smith(49)). RANGE Geastrum quadrifidum was found at least in Owyhee Co. in ID, (Ramsey), in the Great Lakes area of North America, and more widely distributed, (Smith(4)), known throughout the United States, and previously reported from AZ, CA, FL, MI, NJ, NY and TZ, also reported from Canada, Caribbean, Europe, United Kingdom, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand and South America, (Bates). The University of British Columbia has BC collections by Paul Kroeger and by Heather Stirling. Another collection from BC at the University of British Columbia was collected and determined by R. Bandoni under the name Geastrum minus - Geastrum minus was originally described as a variety of G. quadrifidum, but according to Bates(1) the name was used by Cunningham to include G. quadrifidum and G. minimum.

SIMILAR  Lycoperdon umbrinum also has brownish spines even when young but has olive-yellow to yellow-brown spores in mass and does not have broken pedicels in microscopic mounts, and spores are only finely punctate, (Breitenbach). In California, L. umbrinum "is a blackish puffball found in mixed hardwood-conifer woods. It can be differentiated by a finer-textured, darker-colored exoperidium which is discontinuous at maturity, i.e. interspersed between the minute, blackish spines, a cream-yellow to brassy-colored endoperidium can be seen with a hand lens." (MykoWeb). Lycoperdon nigrescens also has brownish spines even when young, but has a reticulate pattern on the inner layer of the covering after the spines fall off, whereas the inner layer of L. molle appears completely smooth without a reticulate pattern after spines fall off, (Breitenbach). Lycoperdon perlatum "differs in an exoperidium composed of conical-shaped, non-convergent spines of two lengths. When shed, the larger spines leave characteristic round scars on the underlying endoperidium, a useful fieldmark", (MykoWeb). L. pyriforme "is unusual among puffballs in having a preference for lignicolous substrates. Identifying characters include a brownish granular, not spinulose exoperidium, a dense white subgleba, stringy white rhizomorphs at the base of the pseudostipe, and a tendency to fruit in large clusters", (MykoWeb).

ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  Lycoperdon is similar to L. pyriforme, but 1) granular patches are smaller and more regular in size, 2) the exoperidium does not slough away - scales and granules dry and produce a sandpapery texture, 3) it grows on soil, 4) the pseudocolumella is distinct with a colored zone below the division from the rest of the fruitbody, 5) it forms a circular pore after the loss of the exoperidium, and 6) spores are 4-4.5 microns in diameter.^ A sample was sent by Alexander Smith to Vincent Demoulin of Liege Belgium who classified it as a western variant of L. pyriforme; however, it differs from that species in significant ways (see SIMILAR for further details). RANGE Lycoperdon nettyana was found in WA (Ramsey).
CHEMICAL REACTIONS  
OUTER SURFACE  fruitbody 2-3cm across, 3-4cm high, with head and stem, head "hemispherical, medium brown, covered with small, (more or less) regular granular patches" that impart light grayish brown color (Kelly 60), granular outer covering interspersed with short conic spines and rounded buttons about 0.2cm apart, outer layer (exoperidium) "at maturity splitting irregularly across the apex and peeling or flaking away"
INNER LAYER  endoperidium when exposed, persistent, light grayish yellowish brown (Kelly 79), lustrous, smooth; "apical pore soon forming, circular", less than 1cm across
SPORE MASS  grayish brown (Kelly 61) to moderate brown (Kelly 58) near or at maturity, with a distinct pseudocolumella rising to near apex
STEM  pseudostem narrowing to base, surface "pallid with scattered dark granules and reduced gland-like projections"; sterile base whitish, pigmented in uppermost 0.5cm, with empty loculae [locules] less than 0.1cm across, sterile base distinctly separated from spore mass by a thin layer of collapsed loculae that is centrally elevated about 0.2cm at the base of the pseudocolumella; pseudostem "attached to substrate by white rhizomorphs"; (while the proportions are not given the stem appears in the photographs to be about as long as the head is high)

NAME ORIGIN  after Nettie Laycock who found the type
SIMILAR  Lycoperdon pyriforme somewhat similar but 1) L. nettyana is covered with granular patches similar to but smaller and more regular in size than L. pyriforme, 2) L. pyriforme does not slough away the exoperidium: its scales and granules dry on the surface of the endoperidium to produce a sandpapery texture, 3) L. pyriforme is always found on wood or wood debris, whereas L. nettyana was found on soil, 4) L. pyriforme does not exhibit a distinct pseudocolumella, nor a sharp division between sterile and fertile tissues, nor a discolored zone below the division, 5) L. pyriforme forms an irregular pore slowly while L. nettyana forms a circular pore after loss of the exoperidium, and 6) L. pyriforme has spores 2.8-3.5 microns while L. nettyana has spores from 4-4.5 microns in diameter, (Ramsey). Of other Lycoperdon species that lose the exoperidium by peeling or flaking, Lycoperdon curtisii lacks a sterile base, Lycoperdon rimulatum has a smooth exoperidium, and Lycoperdon marginatum does not have a stem and its sterile base has much larger loculae, (Ramsey).

Scleroderma citrinum has prominent inherent rosette-like scales (i.e. each scale often with a central wart), and spores are strongly reticulate and smaller (8-13 microns across), (Arora). Other Pacific Northwest species have reticulate or somewhat reticulate spores.

NAME ORIGIN  
SIMILAR  S. bovista is differentiated from Scleroderma meridionale, Scleroderma hypogaeum, and Scleroderma michiganense by the diameter of the spores, (Guzman). Scleroderma citrinum has a very scaly surface. Scleroderma cepa, Scleroderma laeve, Scleroderma albidum, Scleroderma areolatum, and Scleroderma verrucosum do not have reticulate spores, and the last two have well defined scales. Scleroderma meridionale has a rhizomorphic base 3/4 of its total length. Scleroderma floridanum has small, well defined scales, and smaller spores with less well defined reticulum. Scleroderma polyrhizon has smaller less reticulate spores. See also SIMILAR section of Scleroderma polyrhizum.

SIMILAR  Scleroderma laeve and Scleroderma albidum are differentiated by spore diameter (Guzman). S. laeve has a thin peridium (< 0.1cm when dry), whereas S. cepa has a thick peridium (> 0.1cm when dry), (Sims). Scleroderma areolatum has a thinner peridium (less than 0.1cm when dry), opens out across an apical pore rather than opening in star-like fashion, and has larger spores measuring (10)11-17(18) microns, (Guzman). Scleroderma verrucosum has a thin peridium (less than 0.1cm when dry), small scales, and opens out across an apical pore rather than opening in star-like fashion, (Guzman). Scleroderma citrinum has prominent inherent scales (each scale often with a central wart), lobes do not bend outward or unfold appreciably, and spores are strongly reticulate, (Arora). S. citrinum has profuse scales disposed in rosettes and reticulate-spiny spores, (Guzman). Other Pacific Northwest species also have reticulate or somewhat reticulate spores.

NAME ORIGIN  
SIMILAR  Scleroderma texense is not known to occur in the Pacific Northwest, but is similar: differentiated by the scales on the peridium (conspicuously cracked-scaly with scales flat or subpyramidal, irregular in form, reaching more than 0.2cm in diameter and overlapping), the thickness of the walls of the peridial hyphae (more than 1 micron in the outer layer of the peridium, in S. polyrhizum thin or thick in this layer but not as conspicuous as in S. texense), and the reaction of the spore mass with KOH (yellow to reddish rose, none in S. polyrhizum), (Guzman, but a note in Sims indicates that the spores in the type material of S. texense are actually echinulate and not subreticulate, and also that the peridium of S. texense is squarrose and the spore mass distinctive fuscous black, differentiating it from Scleroderma cepa with scaly to coarsely cracked peridium and mouse-gray spore mass). Scleroderma cepa, Scleroderma laeve, and Scleroderma albidum have non-reticulate spores. Scleroderma areolatum and Scleroderma verrucosum have distinct scales, non-reticulate spores and dehiscence is rarely star-like. Scleroderma floridanum has a surface covered in irregular scales and cracks (Sims). Scleroderma citrinum has scales in rosettes and spores that often but not always have a well defined reticulum (Sims). Scleroderma bovista and Scleroderma hypogaeum have larger spores with a well defined reticulum. Scleroderma polyrhizon might be mistaken for large cup fungus such as Sarcosphaera but usually has some powdery spore mass to distinguish it, (Arora). Earthstars have an inner spore case (Arora). Mycenastrum corium has "a thick white felty outer peridium and a smooth, purple-brown inner one which splits into lobes at maturity", (Arora).

NOTES  Features include 1) a spherical or pear-shaped fruitbody that is straw-yellowish (contrasting with scales that are dark brown), turning reddish when young fruitbodies are rubbed, 2) the surface smooth when young, scaly when mature from cracking of the surface near the top, the scales conspicuous, flat, irregular in shape, small (less than 0.1cm), larger at the top than on the sides, and giving the surface the appearance of leopard skin, but sometimes falling off, 3) consistency fleshy to hard, 4) the peridium [covering layer] less than 0.1cm thick, whitish in section, 5) dehiscence [opening] irregular across a poorly defined pore in the top part of the fruitbody, in rare cases somewhat stelliform [star-like], 6) a spore mass that when immature is fleshy and white, but when mature powdery and yellowish brown or more olivaceous, and with very slender whitish or yellowish filaments, 7) pseudostem often present, 8) growth on the ground in hardwood woods, gardens, parks, and streets, and 9) round spores with conic spines.^ The name Scleroderma verrucosum Pers. has also been used for Scleroderma areolatum Ehrenb., with large spores, from 10-18 microns in diameter, for instance by Guzman in 1967, but both Guzman in his 1970 monograph and Sims(1) specify the smaller-spored species. As a further complication, Sims(1) suggests that the small-spored taxon described here may constitute two species, one with sharp narrow spines and one with blunt conic spines. RANGE Scleroderma verrucosum has been found in ID, FL, MI, United Kingdom, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and the Solomon Islands, (Sims).

SIMILAR  Scleroderma areolatum has an areolate surface (cracked like dried mud as opposed to being covered in small scales), and larger spores 11-15 microns, with long narrow spines <2 microns (as opposed to blunt conic spines or sharp narrow spines <1 micron long), (Sims). S. areolatum has a shorter stem structure and is often smaller, (Buczacki). S. areolatum is ornamented from the outset by fine areolate scales, whereas S. verrucosum is smooth at first then with fine non-areolate scales, (Courtecuisse). Scleroderma cepa has a thicker, smoother peridium (usually more than 0.1cm when dry), and opens in star-like fashion, (Guzman). Scleroderma laeve has a thicker smoother peridium, opens in star-like fashion, and has larger spores (9)10.2-13.6(15.2) microns in diameter, (Guzman). Scleroderma albidum has thicker, smoother peridium (over 0.1cm), smooth or cracked on the apical part or with poorly defined scales the same color as the background but with the cracks often yellowish orange, and opening is star-like, whereas S. verrucosum has peridium less than 0.1cm thick, a different scale pattern, and dehiscence across an apical pore, (Guzman). Scleroderma citrinum has prominent inherent rosette-like scales (i.e. each scale often with a central wart), and spores are strongly reticulate. Other Pacific Northwest species have reticulate or somewhat reticulate spores.

ENGLISH NAMES  cannon fungus, sphere thrower, artillery fungus
NOTES  Also listed in Bird's Nests category. Sphaerobolus iowensis L.B. Walker was found in 2005 to be as common or more common than S. stellatus in North America (Geml(2)). The two species must be differentiated microscopically.^ "Early gleba development in young basidiocarps of S. stellatus is marked by the formation of globular knots of binucleate hyphae. These later become centers around which new basidia are formed, eventually producing four (occasionally eight) basidiospores per basidium. The basidia entirely break down and disappear as soon as the spores are mature, making room for the enlargement and maturation of other basidia. In S. iowensis, the development of young basidia is followed by the formation of characteristic cavities or chambers in which the spores are produced (Walker, 1927). In addition, the glebal covering (peridium) consists of a three-layered endoperidium and three-layered exoperidium in S. stellatus, whereas in S. iowensis a gelatinous layer in the outer peridium is absent (Walker, 1927)." (Geml(1) with Latin names italicized). A third North American species of Sphaerobolus, Sphaerobolus ingoldii J. Geml, D.D. Davis & D.M. Geiser, has smaller fruitbodies (rarely exceeding 1-1.5 mm) and peridioles (0.6-1.3 mm), slightly larger spores given as 8.780 +/- 0.761 x 5.874 +/- 0.583 microns and as (7.2)8-9.5(10.2) x (5)5.4-6.2(7.1) microns, no gemmae [asexual propagules borne singly or in chains at the ends of hyphae], and other differences in cultural characteristics. It has been recorded so far from the USA (Georgia, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania) and Japan. (Geml(2)). RANGE The distribution of Sphaerobolus iowensis as confirmed by molecular means includes at least IN, MD, MI, NC, NY, OH, and PA, (Geml(1)), and a map in Geml(2) shows additional data points in WA, SC, WI, and WV.

ENGLISH NAMES  cannon fungus, sphere-thrower, artillery fungus, shooting-star
NOTES  Also listed in Bird's Nests category. Sphaerobolus stellatus produces small, white to dull orange spheres growing gregariously on wood, plant debris, or manure, which split into star-like rays exposing the chestnut brown to olive-black egg which is shot out, leaving the translucent whitish receptacle turned inside out. The spore distribution mechanism is remarkable in that the fungus can project its peridioles up to 6 meters, normally toward the brightest light in its environment, hence acquiring the common names "artillery fungus" and "cannonball fungus". In recent years this fungus has attracted attentions because the peridioles are difficult to remove from house siding, windows, and cars.^ Basidiospores are stimulated to germinate in the digestive system of mammals that have ingested them with plant material. If they are not ingested, the asexual spores can germinate directly on wood or plant debris. (Geml(2)). The flight of the "egg" has been measured at 14 feet high and 17 feet long, and light is apparently needed for the trigger mechanism as the flight does not happen in the dark, (Arora). Turning on a light in a dark room may trigger the release of the sphere, (Lincoff(2)). Lincoff(1) notes after describing Sphaerobolus stellatus, "On the basis of size and habitat various similar species have been described which may be considered as varieties of S. stellatus: S. giganteus, reaching 4 mm in diameter; S. solen, with cylindrical carpophores; S. stercorarius, globose, completely buried in droppings of herbivores; S. muscosus, covered with an abundant mycelium; S. brasiliensis, like the above with larger spores, 10-12 x 6-7 microns." In 2005 it was discovered that Sphaerobolus iowensis was as common as or more common than S. stellatus (see NOTES under S. iowensis). S. stellatus is traditionally considered with bird's nests but in Dictionary of the Fungi, 10th Edition, it is assigned to the Geastraceae. RANGE Sphaerobolus stellatus has been reported from BC (P. Kroeger, pers. comm.), WA (D. Oliver, pers. comm.), OR (Zeller(2)), ID (Trueblood(1)), and CA (MykoWeb). It is said to be widely distributed in eastern North America west to MI and TX, (Phillips), and throughout eastern United States, west to MI, OH, IA, LA, (Lincoff(2)). It is said to occur in Europe and North Africa, (Courtecuisse), including the United Kingdom (Palmer(1)); however, some of these records may be Sphaerobolus iowensis. The attached photos could also be S. iowensis. Geml(1) confirmed by molecular means a distribution for Sphaerobolus stellatus including at least AK, MA, MD, MN, PA, and the Netherlands, and a map in Geml(2) shows additional data points in OR, CO, MO, and NC.

NOTES  Features include 1) spherical spore-sac on a stem, 2) exoperidium thin membranous and dirty brown to whitish, persisting at the base of the spore-sac, 3) endoperidium covered most of the time with small scales, becoming whitish, 4) mouth circular, small and not projecting much, 5) socket where stem attached conspicuous, bearing a membrane at its border that is wavy or lacerate, 6) spore mass ochraceous, 7) stem whitish and wrinkled-scaly, 8) growth in sandy soil, 9) round to elliptic almost smooth spores, and 10) characters of the capillitium.^ Wright comments, "This is an ill-defined species, easy to mistake with others, mostly due to the indistinct ornamentation of the spores, even when observed under a high-power immersion oil objective. This results quite evident [sic] from the number of collections in the herbaria under this name that belong to other species. Our description coincides basically with Long’s (1946), mainly in the measurements, but differs in the nature of the exoperidium. In a later paper, Long (1947) makes it a synonym of T. jourdani Pat. [Latin name underlined], but I believe it ought to be maintained as valid until further evidence points to the contrary." The description is derived from Wright(1). RANGE Collections were examined from AZ, CA, NM, TX, Mexico, Argentina, Spain, Sweden, and Australia, (Wright). The University of Michigan has 3 collections submitted by Ellen Trueblood from ID, determined by D. Prusso.

Tulostoma obesum is similar according to Lloyd's observations (see also NOTES): in Wright's key they separate on the basis that spores are smooth to imperceptibly granulose in T. americanum, and smooth in T. volvulatum [T. obesum], but no mention is made of a volva-like structure in either T. americanum or the similar T. caespitosum.

NAME ORIGIN  refers to fungus being camouflaged as another species, thus simulating it^, (Wright)
SIMILAR  T. beccarianum is close to Tulostoma brumale and could constitute a North American variety of it, but is maintained as separate species because it has somewhat different spores (under the scanning electron microscope), (Wright).

ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  This form of Tulostoma fimbriatum var. campestre is characterized by having a rather long stem measuring 5-8cm, whose underground part is "normally covered by numerous mycelial threads, some tending to become rhizomorphic, that usually persist for a long time. The spore-sac is usually more flattened, the mouth less prominent in herbarium specimens and the stem more frequently tapering toward the base", the spores under scanning electron microscopy "are seen to have a more anastomosed ornamentation which in some instances may become subreticulate". (Wright(1)). Wright speculates that it may be just a growth condition.^ RANGE Collections were examined from ON, CA, MI, NY, WY, France, and Sweden, (Wright), and WA and ID, (Oliver(1) as T. fibrillosum V.S.

CHEMICAL REACTIONS  
OUTER SURFACE  spherical to spherical-depressed, usually 1.5-2.5cm in diameter, not separated from stem; exoperidium "typically hyphal, the threads mixed with sand particles and persistent only at the base, ochraceous greyish"
INNER LAYER  endoperidium thick to parchment-like, "whitish to ochraceous, isabelline, light greyish brown to cinereous", smooth or, more generally, with pits or scars of the large sand grains; mouth typically fimbriate [fringed], almost flat to slightly mammose, with a border that may be granulose or, more commonly, denticulate [finely toothed], tearing when old and losing many of the former characters; socket (where stem attaches) "appressed to very conspicuous most times with an entire to denticulate or lacerate membrane, separated from stem"
SPORE MASS  ochraceous to cinnamon, sometimes ferruginous

NOTES  Features include 1) spherical spore-sac on a stem, 2) exoperidium a loose hyphal layer mixed with sand grains, falling off early, with only a hard band remaining at base, 3) endoperidium ochraceous whitish to yellowish, nearly smooth or with scars of sand grains, 4) mouth up to 0.2cm across, circular, hardly projecting to flat with a rim, 5) socket (where stem joins) inconspicuous, with a torn toothed membrane attached to its border, 6) spore mass ferruginous, 7) stem nearly woody, sometimes grooved in upper fourth, reddish whitish, and with large scales in the remaining part, 8) growth in sandy soil, 9) spores 4.6-6.1 microns in diameter, round to elliptic, and slightly asperulate to almost smooth, and 10) characters of capillitium.^  Oliver(1) says it is the most common and widespread species of Tulostoma in the Pacific Northwest, showing great variability in size of fruitbodies and degree of spore ornamentation. The description is derived from Wright(1). RANGE Collections were examined from CA, NM, WY, Algeria, South Africa, China, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Australia, (Wright), Mexico (Moreno(3)), and WA and OR, (Oliver(1)). The University of Michigan has 11 collections submitted from ID by Ellen Trueblood or Nancy Smith Weber, some determined by J. Wright and others by D. Prusso, and one submitted by E. Trueblood from OR, determined by J. Wright.

ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  Features include 1) spherical to spherical-depressed spore-sac on a stem, 2) exoperidium lightly colored, thinly membranous, most times appearing as a thin indistinct hyphal layer, falling off rapidly, persisting at the base of the spore-sac, 3) endoperidium tough, relatively thick (but papery when old), whitish, chamois-like, smooth, 4) mouth circular, flat, without a rim, rapidly torn, some spore-sacs with more than one mouth, 5) socket (where stem attached) not very conspicuous, thick ring at the base, 6) spore mass chocolate color to very dark ferruginous to sepia, 7) stem stout, up to 7cm long and 0.9cm wide, nearly equal, slightly narrowing toward base, colored as the exoperidium or slightly darker, wrinkled, finely scaly, fibrous, or striate, with conspicuous a volva-shaped structure at the base, in some specimens with a rooting rhizomorphic base, 8) growth in sandy soils in exposed desertic or semidesertic areas, 9) smooth spores that are nearly round to elliptic, and 10) characters of capillitium.^ The nomenclature was uprooted in 1999 (A. Altes, G. Moreno, and J.E. Wright) by the discovery that the type of T. volvulatum Borshch., a name that had been used for this taxon, actually had ornamented spores, necessitating a new name. "obesum" had been used for a variety of T. volvulatum by Wright(1) which "differs from type variety by its globose-mammose spore-sac, and its aborted mammose mouth". (The key in the monograph gives "Spore-sac globose, sometimes umbonate; mouth abortive; in deserts or semidesertic regions of the world" for var. obesum, and "Spore-sac depressed-globose; mouth usually indistinct; in deserts of the world" for var. volvulatum.) The description used here is derived from Wright(1) for T. volvulatum var. volvulatum. RANGE Collections of T. volvulatum var. volvulatum were examined from CA, NM, TX, UT, Algeria, Egypt, Mauritania, Sudan, Tunisia, China, India, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan, (CO and Pakistan were also included in the distribution), (Wright(1)). Collections for T. volvulatum var. elatum (a variety dubiously based on a sample with long stems) were also examined from AZ, Argentina, Mauritania, Namibia, Somalia, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, and China (Wright(1)). Collections of T. volvulatum var. obesum were examined from CO, KS, Georgia (Asia), and Kazakhstan, (Wright(1)). The University of Michigan has many collections from ID, as T. volvulatum, T. volvulatum var. volvulatum, T. volvulatum var. obesum, and T. volvulatum var. elatum, as well as a number designated T. volvulatum from OR: all of these from ID and OR were determined in 1994 by J. Wright.
CHEMICAL REACTIONS  
OUTER SURFACE  spore sac up to 2.5cm in diameter, averaging 2cm, spherical to spherical-depressed; exoperidium thinly membranous, falling off rapidly, most times appearing as a thin hyphal layer, quite indistinct, perfectly separable from endoperidium, sometimes outwardly agglutinated with sand; light colored; persisting at the base
INNER LAYER  endoperidium tough, relatively thick and only becoming papyraceous when old and empty; almost white with or without pink hues, sometimes slightly ochraceous or cream; feeling chamois-like, very smooth; mouth up to 0.3cm across, circular, generally flat, without a rim or lip, rapidly becoming lacerate [torn] and most times remaining as an indefinite torn opening (circular nature soon disappears), some spore sacs have more than one mouth; socket (where stem attaches) "not very conspicuous, not very separated from stem and, in some specimens, closely embracing it by means of the prominent discoid membrane of the collar which appears as a thick ring at the base"

ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  Tulostoma pulchellum var. subfuscum has almost the same features as T. pulchellum, but microscopically there are "somewhat different spores, that have a thick episporium and rather conspicuous verrucae", and in many collections small pseudomycosclereids appear on the endoperidium.^ The description was derived from Wright(1). RANGE Collections were examined from AZ, CA, CO, MI, MO, WY, South Africa, Israel, and Australia, (Wright as T. subfuscum), and the Czech Republic (Wright as T. hollosii). The University of Michigan has several collections submitted by Ellen Trueblood and by Nancy Smith Weber from ID, some determined in 1994 by D. Prusso and some by J. Wright (as T. subfuscum). The last is curious, because J. Wright in 1992 was co-author of Moreno(2) which proposed that this taxon be renamed as a variety of T. pulchellum.

MICROSCOPIC  spores differ from those of T. pulchellum in having a thick episporium and rather conspicuous verrucae under light microscope; moreover, under scanning electron microscope, "the ornamentation appears as even, hemispheric verrucae, very closely packed and many arranged in helicoidal manner, forming striae, much like in T. striatum Cunningh. in which the striae are not formed by verrucae" [T. striatum underlined]^; in many collections small pseudomycosclereids appear on the endoperidium (at another point in the description these are called small mycosclereids)
NAME ORIGIN  refers to the color of the endoperidium^ (Wright)
SIMILAR  Tulostoma pulchellum var. pulchellum has almost the same macromorphological features but differs microscopically (see NOTES), (Wright). Tulostoma striatum has almost the same macromorphological features but differs microscopically by having strongly striate spores: under the scanning electron microscope the striae are not formed by verrucae. Wright comments, "There might be here a nice example of evolution from the flat, appressed, crowded verrucae of T. pulchellum through the small, numerous, appressed, crowded, sometimes into rosaries of helicoidally arranged striae in T. subfuscum, to the strongly striate spores (the striae not formed by verrucae at the SEM level), in T. striatum, considering that the three have almost the same macromorphological features and habitat possibly even coexisting in the same habitats", (Wright, with Latin names underlined).

ENGLISH NAMES  western lawn puffbowl, western lawn puffball
NOTES  Features of Vascellum lloydianum include 1) a top-shaped or depressed-spherical fruitbody with a narrowed base, 2) an outer layer white when young, with soft spines that are often joined at the top in groups of 3-5, with smaller spines and granules in between, all falling away by maturity, 3) an inner layer that is smooth, grayish and shiny, with a wide, often lobed opening, 4) a spore mass that is white at first, becoming yellow-olivaceous to light brownish olive and powdery, 5) sterile base occupying the lower half of the fruitbody with large chambers, white when young but brownish to purplish when mature, when old separated from the spore mass by a line, (the sterile persisting as an urn shape after spore dispersal), 6) attachment to the substrate by small pad of dirt and mycelium or by a rhizomorph, 7) spores that are round or nearly round, showing minute warts under oil immersion, and 8) other microscopic characters.^ The description is derived from Smith(39) except where noted. Vascellum lloydianum is close to Vascellum pratense and has been regarded as a synonym, so that Pacific Northwest records of Vascellum pratense may be the same species as Vascellum lloydianum even if the two are different species. The close but not identical relationship is supported in the molecular study of Jarvis(1). Both species (or the one species if they are the same) may be better placed in Lycoperdon. The current name of Vascellum pratense in the online Species Fungorum, accessed March 31, 2018 was Lycoperdon pratense but MycoBank, accessed the same day, gave the current name as Vascellum pratense. The master’s thesis of Jarvis(1) combines Vascellum lloydianum provisionally as Lycoperdon lloydianum. By whatever name Vascellum lloydianum is fairly common in the Pacific Northwest. RANGE The holotype of Vascellum lloydianum is from WA. It has been known by several other names: Lycoperdon depressum Bonorden, Vascellum depressum (Bon.) F. Smarda, Calvatia depressa (Bon.) Zeller & Smith, (Zeller(13) who examined a collection from OR and said it was common in the Pacific Coast states), and Vascellum pratense (Pers.: Pers.) Kreisel, with which some authors synonymize the four other names, or the last three of the four. A.H. Smith differentiates Vascellum lloydianum A.H. Sm. from V. pratense (see SIMILAR), using collections from WA and giving range as "grassy areas west of the Great Plains, especially in the Pacific Northwest", while giving the range of Vascellum pratense (Pers.) Kreisel as "Asia, Europe, possibly rarely in eastern North America". The same taxon (or one very close) is recorded from CA (Arora(1)). Vascellum lloydianum has been collected in AZ (Bates). Jarvis(1) examined both L. vascellum and L. 'lloydianum' from CA for her master's thesis. There are collections labeled Vascellum pratense from British Columbia at the University of British Columbia.

SIMILAR  Vascellum pratense (Pers.) Kreisel (Lycoperdon pratense Pers. according to the online Species Fungorum, accessed January 24, 2015) is similar. 1) It has the lower part of the endoperidium with rare hyphae with thick colored walls (V. lloydianum having the lower portion of endoperidium with numerous hyphae with thick, colored walls, some of which extend into the spore mass as eucapillitial threads). 2) V. pratense also has a well developed diaphragm between spore mass and sterile base (poorly developed to absent in V. lloydianum). 3) spores are "punctate to minutely warty" (in V. lloydianum "subsmooth" or "smooth in optical section but surface minutely verruculose under oil"). (Smith(39)). Ramsey reports a collection from the University of Washington campus that fits at least the macroscopic description of V. pratense better than that of V. lloydianum, (Ramsey(1)). L. pratense and L. lloydianum "are very similar in outward appearance, which can cause confusion and misidentification among them. Lycoperdon pratense has non-poroid eucapillitium that is scarce to absent, and can be found only along the endoperidium wall in mature gasterocarps, as long as gleba tissue is still present. As well, Lycoperdon pratense has a wide and very well developed diaphragm that can be seen earlier in development than that in Lycoperdon lloydianum (Ponce de Leon 1970, Bates 2004). Both of these grassland species have been collected together in the same habitat. Close examination of the diaphragm and growth of the eucapillitium is necessary for proper treatment of these species." (Jarvis(1) with Latin names italicized). Lycoperdon species do not have the thin papery membrane that separates the sterile base from the spore mass in Vascellum species, (Trudell).
