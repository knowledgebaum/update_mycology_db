LATIN NAMES  Abortiporus biennis  (Bull.) Singer^  Mycologia 36:68. 1944;  Daedalea biennis  (Bull.) Fr.
ENGLISH NAMES  blushing rosette
NOTES  Features include 1) a fruitbody that is variable in shape and size, and is bracket-like, or top-shaped or rosette-like with a central or lateral stem, 2) a cap that is whitish to pale brown, 3) flesh with an upper spongy layer and a lower firm layer, 4) light buff pores that are angular to maze-like, 5) a tendency of the fruitbody to turn red-brown when handled or injured, 6) a tendency of the fruitbody to incorporate pieces of plants, and microscopic characters.^ Abortiporus biennis is unusual in producing chlamydospores on various parts of the fruitbody (for instance the cap and the stem). A distorted form occurs with no apparent orientation of tubes and may appear poroid over the entire surface.

ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  Features include pale apricot to pinkish yellow or pinkish buff fruiting bodies, single to several on branching stem, growing on ground, with weakly amyloid spores and clamp connections^. The description is derived from Gilbertson(1) except where noted. Ginns(1) says that "Although 10 collections of Albatrellus flettii were seen from Washington, no confirmed specimens of Albatrellus confluens are known from the state, although it is reported by Gilbertson and Ryvarden (1986). Perhaps in western North America, Albatrellus flettii is more common than Albatrellus confluens, or perhaps in this area there is only one species, which differs from Albatrellus confluens elsewhere in having the pileus when young with blue tints, and when old, either lacking the blue or mottled with blue. The rare morphological differences in basidiomes indicate that these are sister species and may be subspecies.". One implication is that at least some reports of A. confluens in western North America may have been based on faded fruitbodies of A. flettii. Audet(1) supported the use of the name Albatrellopsis confluens (Alb. & Schwein.) Teixeira, Boletim do Instituto de Botanica, Sao Paulo 8: 21 (1993). The online Species Fungorum, accessed February 3, 2019, maintained the Albatrellus confluens name as current, despite accepting the Albatrellopsis name for the similar (and according to Audet(1) closely related) Albatrellus flettii.

SIMILAR  The characters of this genus are similar to those of Postia with the exception of the amyloid hyphae and cystidia. Postia fragilis (=Oligoporus fragilis) fruitbodies resemble less robust specimens of A. lapponica and also show the reddish-brown color change on bruising, but P. fragilis lacks the capitately incrusted amyloid cystidia of A. lapponica, spore size is smaller, and pore size is slightly smaller, (Gilbertson). A. lapponica has cylindric spores 8-11 x 2.5-3.5 microns, clamp connections, and amyloid metuloids, Leptoporus mollis has allantoid spores 5-6 x 1.5-2 microns, no clamp connections, and no cystidia, and Postia fragilis has allantoid spores 4-5 x 1-1.5 microns, clamp connections, and no cystidia, (Ginns(25)). Sarcoporia polyspora also stains reddish brown, has elliptic to cylindric spores measuring 5-7 x 2.5-4.0 microns, has clamp connections, and lacks cystidia.

NOTES  Features include flat annual growth on conifer wood, soft cottony consistency, small pores that are angular and white to cream, margin white and wide, sometimes with rhizomorphs, and microscopic characters^. The name Antrodia gossypina is used commonly but is incorrect. The basionym was Poria gossypium Speg., using the noun 'gossypium' - 'cotton'. Because this epithet is a noun, it does not change its gender to agree with the genus. Thus Fibroporia gossypia (as used by Parmasto) is not a correct combination. The adjective 'gossypina' would be a permissible species epithet meaning 'pertaining to cotton' or 'cottony', an adjective which would agree with the gender of the genus. But that was not the name originally applied to the species by Spegazzini. (Dai(2)). The description derived from Gilbertson(1).

ENGLISH NAMES  kurotake, kurokawa
NOTES  Features include a well-defined cap and stem, colors of various gray tones, often wavy or lobed cap margin, small white pores that soon discolor, growth on the ground, and angular-warty spores.^ We include in Boletopsis grisea group at least the species Boletopsis grisea which is generally a pine associate, and Boletopsis leucomelaena which is generally a spruce associate, but there may be other species as discussed below. The species concepts will likely change with further research. Gilbertson(1) uses the name Boletopsis subsquamosa. The same authors in 1993 considered the type of P. subsquamosus as probably not a species of Boletopsis at all, and Boletopsis leucomelaena a rare circumboreal species. The name Boletopsis grisea (Peck) Bondartsev & Singer is available, but there are further complications. Analysis of DNA sequences from three Oregon collections showed two to be consistent with Boletopsis grisea and the third from unknown habitat showing some molecular affinity to the newly described pine associate Boletopsis perplexa Watl. & Milne from Scotland (the latter species close to Boletopsis leucomelaena which is a spruce associate and according to the authors' observations found in the Pacific Northwest but not among the sequenced collections). In the same study a fourth collection from Wind River (presumably Wyoming) appeared to be another unidentified sequence. (Watling). Trudell(4) say, "Current thought suggests that at least three species could occur in the PNW. Our commonest one seems to be B. grisea (= B. subsquamosa), which apparently occurs mostly with pine; it has a dull gray to blackish, often radially streaked, cap that sometimes is slightly scaly near the center. The similar B. leucomelaena occurs mainly with spruce. Boletopsis smithii is known from a single collection in Washington and is distinctive by the orange coloration of the cap and stipe." (Trudell, Latin names italicized). Boletopsis smithii is not considered a member of the Boletopsis grisea group in this program. Siegel(2) describe Boletopsis grisea and Boletopsis leucomelaena as follows, with Latin names italicized, "B. grisea appears to be limited to pine forest and has whitish to pale gray colors when young, developing darker streaks and stains in age. B. leucomelaena has a black cap, white to light gray pores, and a gray stipe (often with an orangish base), and grows with spruce." RANGE Members of this group are found in BC, WA, OR, ID, also NS, AL, CA, GA, MA, MI, MO, MT, NC, NH, NJ, NY, PA, TN, and VA.

NAME ORIGIN  from Latin, "somewhat scaly"^, (Lincoff(1))
SIMILAR  A fungus in the Boletopsis grisea group could be mistaken for a bolete and unlike most polypores, the thin tube layer is fairly easy to peel from the cap but the pore layer is thin, and the cap shape is different and usually irregular. Albatrellus colors are different: Albatrellus avellaneus can be similar in color but stains yellow. See also SIMILAR section of Boletopsis smithii.

ENGLISH NAMES  red-belted polypore, redbelt, red-belt conk, red-belted bracket
NOTES  Fomitopsis mounceae has shelf-like  to hoof-shaped, hard fruiting bodies with a reddish or partially reddish upper surface (often shiny, resinous, or tacky, sometimes looking varnished). The margin is more lightly colored and rounded. The pallid pores do not bruise brown. The upper surface may be entirely blackish in old fruitbodies. This is the commoner of the two species in the Fomitopsis pinicola complex in the Pacific Northwest, the other being Fomitopsis ochracea.^ |The Fomitopsis pinicola complex is the most common conk in the Pacific Northwest. Haight(1) and Haight(2) found 4 species in the Fomitopsis pinicola complex: one European (Fomitopsis pinicola), one southwest North American (Fomitopsis schrenkii), and the two previously mentioned species both widespread in North America. |In the Pacific Northwest, collections can be reported as Fomitopsis pinicola complex, Fomitopsis mounceae, or Fomitopsis ochracea, depending on whether differentiating features between the latter two species are found. If fruitbodies have a red belt they are Fomitopsis mounceae, but if it is lacking they may be either species. The application of a lit match to the colored tissue near the edge of a fruitbody is said to cause melting in F. mounceae and charring in F. ochracea. A receding pore surface suggests F. ochracea but is not always present. The spores of F. mounceae average longer but this is s difficult criterion to use in practice. |The first description given here is derived from the original description of the species (Haight(1)). The Arora(1) and Gilbertson(1) descriptions are retained for further detail (such as a larger size range) but both describe the Fomitopsis pinicola complex as a whole. |Haight(1) note that the microscopic illustration of F. pinicola in Gilbertson(1) fig. 133 is that of F. mounceae (except that the large cystidia there were not observed in the collections they studied (appearing instead "to be young, developing skeletal hyphae observed in dissepiments"), and the spore measurement given is more similar to F. pinicola. |RANGE In the range map (or the collections examined) of Haight(2), Fomitopsis mounciae is found in BC, WA, OR, ID, and also AB, NL, YT, AK, CA, MT, ME, MI, MN, NH, NY, TN, UT, VT, WI, and WY.

SIMILAR  Fomitopsis ochracea has an ocher band or no band (instead of red, reddish brown, orange, or yellow), the band chars instead of melting in a flame, the underside is sometimes receding, and the spores are shorter on average. |F. ochracea, according to Voitk(2) is 'Marginally smaller than F. pinicola, it can also grow quite big, making size an unhelpful differentiating character. The top is similarly black to gray and only moderately zonate. There is no red band. If there is some coloured tissue near the edge, it does not melt, but chars when exposed to a flame. The edge may be ochre in colour, giving it the name, but it may also be quite drab and gray. The undersurface is light ochre to yellow, often staining darker yellow on handling. The pores are small and round, about 4-6/mm. The cut surface has the characteristic Fomitopsis whorls in the upper body and successive pore layers in the lower. It has a distinctive "sour" smell. During active growth the pore surface, and at times the entire conk, may exhibit dramatic guttation. Its commonest hosts are balsam fir and spruce, but proportionately it is more common on birch than F. pinicola. The original find was on poplar in Alberta. It, also, is quite variable in appearance and can present a definite puzzle for the unwary identifier. Absence of a red laccate band should usually make the determination. If still puzzled, looking at the spores with a microscope should help. The spores of F. ochracea are subglobose (almost round - about like a blown up balloon), while those of F. pinicola are more elliptical' (5.0-6.5 x 3.5-6.0 microns for F. ochracea, 5-8 x 3-4.5 microns for F. pinicola). Voitk(2).

NOTES  Ganoderma lucidum group fruitbodies are shelf-like or with a stem, the caps circular to semicircular or fan-shaped and colored dark reddish brown with a varnished appearance. They grow on hardwood. In the Orient Ganoderma lucidum has been revered as a symbol of success and well-being and used in the treatment of cancer and other illnesses^ (Arora). |Many "studies of Ganoderma in North America and other regions of the world have used the name G. lucidum sensu lato for any laccate (shiny or varnished) Ganoderma species growing on hardwood trees or substrates" (Loyd, with Latin names italicized). The synonyms given in Gilbertson(1), Ganoderma sessile Murrill, and Ganoderma polychromum (Copel.) Murrill, appear in Loyd(1) to be separate species from Ganoderma lucidum sensu stricto. |RANGE Ganoderma lucidum, according to the range map has been found in OR, AL, AR, AZ, CA, CT, FL, GA, IA, IL, IN, KS, KY, LA, MI, MN, MO, MS, NY, OH, OK, PA, TN, TX, VA, WV, and WI, (Gilbertson(1), although they also say "Apparently absent through the Rocky Mountain region and the Pacific Northwest", and some collections may be attributable to Ganoderma polychromum or in eastern North America, Ganoderma sessile - see Loyd(1)), "Ganoderma lucidum is restricted to hardwoods and occurs in the Pacific Northwest, although Gilbertson and Ryvarden (1986) did not know it from this area", (Ginns(25)). It occurs "in both tropical and temperate zones, from Canada to Argentina and Europe to Siberia, China, India, Australia, and Africa", (Arora). Michael Beug has reported Ganoderma lucidum from WA. Ginns(28) says (with Latin names italicized) "Reports of G. lucidum on conifers from western North America probably were based on misidentified specimens of either G. oregonense or G. tsugae." and that Ganoderma lucidum "is restricted to hardwoods and appears to be, at most, rare in the Pacific Northwest. There is one tentative British Columbia record on G. lucidum on Quercus garryana in Victoria". In the molecular investigation of Loyd(1), Ganoderma lucidum collections were only found in isolated locations in California and Utah which suggested to the authors that they resulted from importing the species into North America (possibly from mushroom growers producing G. lucidum outdoors).

Ganoderma lucidum sensu stricto collections were only found in isolated locations in California and Utah which suggested to the authors that they resulted from importing the species into North America (possibly from mushroom growers producing G. lucidum outdoors). On the other hand, three of the five collections of Ganoderma polychromum came from Oregon and the other two from California. MycoBank, accessed September 5, 2018, gave the current name as Ganoderma resinaceum Boud., in Patouillard, Bull. Soc. mycol. Fr. 5(2,3): 72 (1889), but the online Species Fungorum, accessed the same day, maintained them independently. The description is derived from Loyd(1). RANGE Ganoderma polychromum was originally described from CA and NV, has been documented by molecular means from OR and CA (Loyd(1)).
CHEMICAL REACTIONS  
CAP  The illustration in Loyd(1) shows a yellowish brown, matte, applanate cap that has a broad white border. The cap surface is presumably varnished and shiny in this species and the color range is likely to include a more reddish brown, since it is included in Ganoderma lucidum sensu lato.
FLESH  corky; pink-buff to cinnamon-buff; often with conspicuous concentric growth zones present; no resinous or melanoid deposits present
PORES  4-5 pores per mm
STEM  rarely present but when present, short and thin, typically less than the diameter of the cap, and colored tawny to russet

NAME ORIGIN  
SIMILAR  Ganoderma lucidum also grows on hardwoods, has pores spaced at 4-5 per mm, has corky-textured context that is colored pink-buff to cinnamon buff, and has concentric growth zones, but 1) it almost always has a stem, which is long and eccentric, typically twice the diameter of the cap in length, 2) basidiospores were measured at 8.2-12.1 x 4.8-8.9 microns (average 10.7 x 7.1 microns), and 3) chlamydospores were absent, (Loyd(1)). [Note that chlamydospores were said by Gilbertson(1) to be conspicuous in cultures of G. lucidum but Gilbertson(1) synonymized G. polychromum with G. lucidum.] Ganoderma oregonense and Ganoderma tsugae grow on conifers and has spongy to corky context that is white (Loyd(1)).

RANGE Gloeophyllum odoratum has been reported from BC, WA, OR, ID, AZ, CO, MT, and NM, according to Gilbertson(1) who suggest that some records of the species could represent Gloeophyllum protractum: referring to G. odoratum, they comment "Probably rare and restricted to the coniferous forests in the Rocky Mountains. The only report of this anise-scented taxon from North America is that of Neuman (1914) from Wisconsin, and most other reports of the species on the continent are probably referring to G. protractum".

SIMILAR  Gloeophyllum trabeum is generally smaller, has a softer and more bald upper surface, and normally has more gills in the spore-bearing surface, where the pore walls in general are thinner and the pores smaller (3-4 per mm), (Gilbertson). Gloeophyllum protractum is separated from Gloeophyllum odoratum by the former's lack of anise odor, thinner fruitbodies, and normally smoother and more bald cap surface, (Gilbertson).

SIMILAR  Gloeophyllum trabeum has denser gills and smaller pores, the upper surface is usually much smoother and softer, and cystidia are normally more thin-walled, (Gilbertson). G. trabeum has 2-4 pores/gills per mm as opposed to 1.5-2 at cap margin for G. sepiarium, and the fruitbody is hazelnut-brown to gray-brown, (Breitenbach). Other Pacific Northwest Gloeophyllum species have pores. Lenzites betulina grows on hardwoods and has whitish gills. Daedalea quercina and Daedaleopsis confragosa do not have orange-yellow cap colors. Trichaptum laricinum has thin but rigid hairy caps that are tan to gray, and has a purplish gill surface. Gloeophyllum abietinum, according to Gilbertson(1), is a rare species described from the "Rocky Mountains" and otherwise known from Arizona: they distinguish it from G. sepiarium by G. abietinum having more regular gill-like plates and warm brown colors. Ginns(28) says that G. abietinum, which has been cultured from packaged conifer lumber in BC, differs from G. sepiarium in that G. abietinum has "wavy (not straight) lamellae" and "a dark to pale brown pileus surface".

ENGLISH NAMES  conifer-base polypore, root rot
NOTES  Heterobasidion annosum group is recognized by the thin, brown to blackish brown crust on the often grooved or irregular cap surface, and cream-colored pores and margin. The pores reacting strongly with Melzer's reagent. When growing flat without a cap, the margin is often very distinct and slightly raised. Dextrinoid skeletal hyphae can be distinctive (see MICROSCOPIC). |Heterobasidion occidentale is primarily on true fir, hemlock, and Douglas-fir, pores are round to elliptic with about 6% elongated to somewhat daedaleoid, and pore density 8.6 +/- 0.07 pores per square millimeter, whereas Heterobasidion irregulare is primarily on pine and juniper, pores about 10% or more radially elongated to somewhat daedaloid, and pore density 7.3 +/- 0.12 pores per square millimeter (Ginns(28) for British Columbia).^ |The Heterobasidion annosum group in North America appears to belong to two intersterility groups: "the p-type, which occurs mainly on pine, incense cedar, hardwood and brush, and the s-type, which infects other conifer species. The p-type will infect both p-and s-type hosts, whereas the s-type is restricted to s-type hosts." (Allen(1)). |Heterobasidion annosum sensu lato according to Garbelotto and Otrosina consists of at least 5 species, of which two occur in North America: Heterobasidion irregulare Garbelotto & Otrosina Fungal Biology 114: 20. 2010 (corresponding to the p-type) and Heterobasidion occidentale Otrosina & Garbelotto Fungal Biology 114: 20. 2010 (corresponding to the s-type). They measured mean pore density for H. occidentalis in 2 California sites as 8.6 per square mm with 6% of pores irregular and for H. irregulare in California and Georgia sites as 7.3 per square mm with 11% of pores irregular (irregularity of pores is affected by orientation however). |Heterobasidion occidentale is thought to occur in BC and its range is given as western North America from AK to southern Mexico. (Otrosina(1)). Heterobasidion irregulare also occurs in the Pacific Northwest, at least in BC, whereas Heterobasidion annosum is limited to Europe, (Ginns(28)). |RANGE Heterobasidion annosum group has been found in BC, WA, OR, ID, ON, AK, AL, AR, AZ, CA, CO, CT, DE, FL, GA, LA, MA, MD, ME, MI, MN, MO, MS, MT, NC, NH, NJ, NM, NY, PA, TN, TX, VA, VT, WV, Jamaica, and Europe (Gilbertson(1)), and also Asia and Australia (Breitenbach).

'annosum'), 3) grows on live trees only when there is a wound big enough to expose the heartwood, 4) often grows high on trees (H. 'annosum' always formed close to ground), 5) has distinctly stratified tube layers, 6) has flesh that turns red with KOH, 7) has smooth cylindric spores (not finely spiny nearly round to oval ones), and 8) has skeletal hyphae that are not dextrinoid (from several of the sources). Phellinus species have yellowish to orange to rust brown flesh, (Lincoff(2)). The rotted wood with black flecks is similar to the decays caused by Perenniporia subacida and Junghuhnia zonata, (Ginns(28)).

NOTES  Laetiporus gilbertsonii consists of conspicuous, annual, shelving masses of orange, semicircular to fan-shaped fruiting bodies with yellow pore surface, growing on hardwoods^. This species has long been known under the name Laetiporus sulphureus (Bull.: Fr.) Murrill, but that taxon has been found to represent several species, including Laetiporus gilbertsonii and the common Laetiporus conifericola. The description is derived from Burdsall(6). RANGE Laetiporus gilbertsonii is known in the Pacific Northwest from a collection in WA (on Prunus), and a collection in OR (on Quercus garryana), and also occurs in CA. Laetiporus has also occurred on Prunus in British Columbia (I. Gibson, pers. comm.). Var. pallidus (which differs only in its pale colors) was found in FL, LA, and TX, "from Florida west across the states bordering the Gulf of Mexico", (Burdsall). A Washington collection of Laetiporus on aspen had spore size intermediate between Laetiporus conifericola and Laetiporus gilbertsonii, (Dick Bishop, Spore Prints 489:3. 2013). In BC, found "on Populus balsamifera (presumably ssp. trichocarpa) and Quercus garryana on Vancouver Island (Oyster River and Victoria)" (Ginns(28), with Latin names italicized).

Notably absent are A) Phellinus igniarius itself about which they say "The specimens studied by Gilbertson and Ryvarden (1987) might actually represent other members of the P. igniarius complex.", B) Phellinus laevigatus - they imply that North American collections may fall under Phellinus betulinus, and C) Phellinus pomaceus - they rename the North American collections in the study Phellinus pomaceoides. (Zhou, L.-W.(1)). Tom Volk and Diane Pleninger wrote about Phellinus igniarius (in a wide sense), "In northern North America, the ash of Phellinus igniarius conks was widely used with indigenous plants before tobacco arrived. The Denaina, an Athabascan Indian people of the Alaskan interior, chewed a mixture of P. igniarius ash and balsam poplar bark in pre-contact times. Collections in Canadian and US museums show that P. igniarius was used with tobacco by the Micmac of Nova Scotia, Inuit of Labrador, Blackfoot of the North American Plains and Kwakiutl of the Pacific Northwest. This specific basidiocarp was selected and preferred above all other sources of ash. The reason for this is its high pH." (Volk). RANGE Phellinus igniarius group has been found in BC, WA, OR, ID, AB, MB, NT, NB, NF, NS, ON, PE, PQ, SK, YT, AK, AR, CA, CO, CT, IA, IN, KS, MA, MD, ME, MI, MN, MO, MT, ND, NE, NH, NY, OH, PA, SD, TN, UT, VA, VT, WI, WV, and WY, (Gilbertson), and Europe, Asia, and Africa, (Breitenbach).

ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  Features include flat growth on hardwood especially birch, firm attachment and woody consistency, a dull reddish brown pore surface, small, thick-walled pores, and microscopic characters including small spores, parallel tramal hyphae, and setae. There is some molecular evidence suggesting that this species does not occur in North America, despite the extensive records noted in Gilbertson(1).^ Ginns(28) says (with Latin names italicized), "The most reliable characters of P. laevigatus are the small pores, small basidiospores, and the parallel arrangement of the tramal hyphae. The features of P. betulinus and P. prunicola are similar to, or overlap, those of P. laevigatus, making it difficult to name with confidence some collections." The spores are given as 3-4 x 2.5-3.0 microns for P. laevigatus and 3.9-4.5 x 2.8-3.6 microns for P. betulinus, (Ginns(28)). In the Ginns(28) key, P. laevigatus with pores 8-10 per mm and setae 6-9 microns in diam is separated from P. betulinus with pores 6-9 per mm and setae 5.0-6.8 microns in diam. However, in the Zhou, L.-W.(1) DNA study, nine closely related collections separated into three from Europe on Betula (designated P. laevigatus), four from North America on Betula, Magnolia, and Fagus (designated P. betulinus), and two from China on Betula (designated P. parmastoi which is a new name for P. betulinus var. orienticus). Gilbertson lists P. laevigatus for many North American locations (but not P. betulinus), with growth on dead hardwoods, especially birch, pores 8-10 per mm, spores 3-4 x 2.5-3 microns, and setae 17-30 x 6-9 microns, the same measurements as in Ginns(28). RANGE Phellinus laevigatus has been reported from British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Alberta, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia, (Gilbertson), and Europe including the British Isles (Buczacki), and Switzerland (Breitenbach). Many of the North American collections may be Phellinus betulinus, some may be Phellinus prunicola, and Phellinus laevigatus has not been proven for North America by molecular means.

NOTES  Piptoporus betulinus forms a kidney-shaped to round, whitish to brownish bracket with a curb-like extension of margin below the level of the pore surface. It is found only on birch and is common in that habitat.^ It has been used as tinder, as a razor strop, and as an anesthetic, (Phillips). According to Ginns(28) the medicinal properties attributed to it include boosting the immune system and actions against inflammation, viruses, and bacteria. RANGE Piptoporus betulinus has been found in BC, WA, ID, AB, MB, NB, NS, NT, ON, PE, PQ, SK, YT, AK, CT, IA, KS, MA, ME, MI, MN, MT, NC, NH, NJ, NY, PA, TN, VT, WI, and WV, and circumboreally, (Gilbertson). It also occurs in Europe and Asia (Breitenbach).

LATIN NAMES  Polyporoletus sublividus  Snell  Mycologia 28: 467. 1936  group^;  Polyporus canaliculatus  Overh.;  Polyporus sylvestris  Overh.
ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  Features include dark purplish gray cap that fades to brownish, a non-separable pore surface that is purplish gray to avellaneous or olivaceous when old, a lateral to central brown to olivaceous reticulate stem, growth on ground, and spores that have a double layered wall with pillars or partitions between the walls^. |Polyporoletus sublividus was described from Tennessee in Snell(4). This name has been used for years in the Pacific Northwest based on Gilbertson(1). But Luther(3) summarizes a taxonomic uncertainty, "The original (type) collection for Polyporoletus sylvestris was found near Lake Cowichan, Vancouver Island, BC (Canada) in 1929. Polyporus sylvestris was invalidly published by Overholts (1941), who failed to provide a Latin description. Pouzar (1972) described it correctly and transferred it to Albatrellus as A. sylvestris Overholts ex Pouzar. It was listed as a synonym of P. sublividus by Gilbertson & Ryvarden (1986), but the current research by Audet (2010) provides evidence that it is a distinct species, which he transfers to Polyporoletus as P. sylvestris (Overh. ex Pouzar) Audet." |Audet(1) gives a chart differentiating the features of Polyporoletus sublividus and Polyporoletus sylvestris. In addition, Audet(1) describes the new species Polyporoletus bulbosus based on a WA specimen collected by A.H. Smith (30718 in 1948) In his key, Audet separates Polyporoletus bulbosus and P. sylvestris from Polyporoletus sublividus sensu lato on the basis of spore width: about 7.2-10.8 microns for the first two and 9.6-12.6 microns for the third taxon (spores for the holotype of P. sublividus (9)10.2-12 microns wide). Polyporoletus bulbosus is then separated from P. sylvestris on the basis of solitary habit and bulbous stem in the former and cespitose habit and non-bulbous stem in the latter. (Audet(1)). |Interestingly the description of Polyporus sylvestris in the original paper by Overholts involves not only the type but a second A.H. Smith collection (3189 in 1935): "Unfortunately the type collection was unaccompanied by notes descriptive of their fresh condition. That collection was turned over to Dr. Mounce at Ottawa who assisted in the diagnosis. Good notes by Smith on fresh condition of his plants have been incorporated here also." (Overholts(3)). |Overholts also described Polyporus canaliculatus from North Carolina and Tennessee (an invalid name because of an earlier homonym) which was synonymized by Lowe with Polyporus sylvestris. Spores were 8-12 x 8-10 microns, and the fruitbody was single with stem equal or tapering upward (Overholts(2)). |RANGE The range of Polyporoletus sublividus is given by Gilbertson(1) as WA, ID, NC, and TN, (Gilbertson), and the holotype of Polyporus sylvestris is from BC. Ginns(28) says that Polyporus sylvestris is known from BC, WA, OR, and ID.

N. alveolaris also has radially elongated pores but the stem is typically lateral or not well formed, the cap is a reddish yellow to pale brick red, and the spores are 11-14 microns long, (Ginns). Polyporus brumalis "also has more or less radially elongated, diamond-shaped pores, but they are much smaller than those of P. arcularius" as well as less radially elongated, and cap is darker, (Gilbertson). P. brumalis has a much darker cap, smaller and less radially elongated pores (angular but less strikingly hexagonal), and smaller spores, (Ginns).

NOTES  The most conspicuous features are the radially elongated, relatively thick-walled pores and the pronounced umbo that typically develops at the base. Other features include a relatively large, bracket-like, approximately semicircular fruitbody with a tough texture, a bumpy-wavy surface that is whitish to ocher or green from algae, a whitish to gray-ocher pore surface, and microscopic characters including elliptic-cylindric spores and a trimitic hyphal system.^ Domanski(1) described five forms from Eurasia. Forma gibbosa has dimidiate fruitbodies 1-4cm thick, with the white to yellowish upper surface velvety, chamois-like or tomentose (usually bald when old), and pores "more or less rectangular or elongated, radially arranged, sometimes labyrinthine". Forma tenuis has a thinner fruitbody with tubes often confluent and merging into almost gill-like structures. Forma hirsuta is "of moderate size, with a thin margin and zonate surface, covered with dense gray hairs" (resembling those of Trametes hirsuta). Forma kalchbrenneri has a velvety to almost bald surface, zonate with belts either throughout or near the margin, and grayish-ochraceous, light- or rufous-cinnamon in color. Forma amurensis (east Asia) has an azonate or weakly zonate upper surface that is white (cream to grayish when dry), tubes 0.5-1cm long, with thinner walls than forma gibbosa and smaller (0.5 millimeters diameter), circular or angular, radially arranged pores.

SIMILAR  Lenzites elegans (Trametes elegans) (southernmost states and Mississippi basin) is typically much flatter, and even the very large fruitbodies are not more than 1cm thick. The pores are more irregular, in parts distinctly gill-like or even tooth-like. For Trametes gibbosa, triquetrous fruitbodies up to 5-10cm thick at the base and small pores (3-4 per millimeter) regularly elongated in radial direction to 0.2-0.3cm are typical. However, both species are variable in these characters - very flat specimens of T. gibbosa with nearly gill-like tubes in parts of the fruitbody occur quite frequently. The surface of the cap in Trametes gibbosa is hirsute in zones with individual hairs visible with the naked eye or through a 10X lens, but the cap in Lenzites elegans is tomentose with no distinct hairs through a 10X lens.

Postia tephroleuca has slightly narrower spores (4.5-6 x 1-1.5 microns), a monomitic hyphal system without the characteristic branched generative hyphae, and produces a brown rot, (Gilbertson). Postia tephroleuca may lack its typical mouse-gray cap surface, in which case it is differentiated by its narrower (1.0-1.5 microns), allantoid spores, (Ginns(28)).

ENGLISH NAMES  tuckahoe
NOTES  Features include flat growth on wood with the whitish pore surface exposed, and microscopic characters including distinctive wide hyphae. An anamorphic stage of this fungus is a large underground sclerotium, somewhat resembling an oblong coconut, apparently growing from mycelium in roots. Ginns(28) says "Sclerotia have not been reported from western North America". "In North America this same fungus was identified as one of the traditional aboriginal food together with various tuberous plant roots all collectively known as tuckahoe" (Redhead(66)). Wolfiporia cocos (also known as Poria cocos and as fuhling), is one of the traditional cultivated oriental medicinal fungi, (Redhead(66)). In the lab the sclerotium can produce the fruiting bodies described here, but in nature the fruiting bodies occur on dead standing and fallen trees, not generally in association with the tuckahoe stage.^ The online Species Fungorum, accessed January 17, 2005, and again November 18, 2015, gave the current name as Wolfiporia extensa (Peck) Ginns; however, Redhead(66) proposed in 2006, with intricate reasoning, the conservation of the species epithet 'cocos'.
