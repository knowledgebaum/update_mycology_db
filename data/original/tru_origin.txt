ENGLISH NAMES  gastroid Agaricus
NOTES  Also listed in Gilled category. Agaricus deserticola looks like a dry, thick stemmed whitish to buff mushroom with an unexpanded cap (the margin still attached to the stem), but the dark brown spore mass consists of crowded, convoluted, folded or branched plates and/or cavities instead of well-developed gills. Zeller(6) described Longula texensis var. major (without a Latin diagnosis) from California and Mexico which is larger (15-30cm tall with stem bulbose, 5-7cm in diameter at the base when fresh), and has a more conspicuously scaly cap. RANGE Arora says Agaricus deserticola is apparently widespread in the arid and semi-arid areas of the West of North America (from TX to CA and north at least to OR). Zeller(6) examined collections from OR, CA, NM, and TX. Var. 'major' was described from CA and Mexico.

LATIN NAMES  Alpova diplophloeus  (Zeller & C.W. Dodge) Trappe & A.H. Sm.  group^  apud Trappe, Beih. Nova Hedwigia 51: 286. 1975;  Alpova cinnamomeus  C.W. Dodge;  Rhizopogon diplophloeus  Zeller & C.W. Dodge;  Rhizopogon  parvisporus  Bowerman
ENGLISH NAMES  red gravel, alder truffle
NOTES  The Alpova diplophloeus group is distinguished by a nearly spherical to ovoid fruitbody, with a cinnamon-colored surface when mature, a deep reddish orange or deep reddish brown bruising reaction, a spore mass that is reddish brown at maturity and consists of small gel-filled chambers and pallid veins, and underground growth with a preference for alder. There are distinctive microscopic characters as well, including spores that are amyloid when young and inamyloid when mature, 6-spored to 8-spored basidia, and a distinctive peridial layer with clamp connections - dermatocystidia are present and often conspicuous^. |The Alpova diplophloeus group consists of at least three species according to Hayward(1) who used a combination of molecular and morphological characters. The holotypes of two of these are from the Pacific Northwest: Alpova diplophloeus from Friday Harbour WA, and Alpova concolor from Siuslaw National Forest OR (with supporting material from Maple Ridge, BC). Hayward(1) say of Alpova concolor (with Latin name italicized) "The structurally distinct two-layered peridium and existence in the Pacific Northwest of the United States causes us to suspect that Zeller and Dodge included this species in their concept of Alpova diplophloeus even though the holotype of Alpova diplophloeus does not belong to this species. At least among surveys that have deposited sequences in international sequence repositories, this species appears to be more common than A. diplophloeus". A third species, Alpova cinnamomeus (synonym Rhizopogon parvisporus) was described from Michigan and occurs also at least in Newfoundland-Labrador. |The three species can be differentiated as follows. Alpova diplophloeus has a structurally single-layered peridium, and spores more than 2.2 microns wide, whereas the other two have two structurally distinct layers and spores on average less than 2.2 microns wide. In Alpova cinnamomeus, the peridium separates easily from the gleba (spore mass), and the peridia cells collapse fully on drying, whereas in Alpova concolor the peridium is not easily separable and the peridial cells do not collapse fully on drying. The characters of Alpova diplophloeus include 1) a poorly differentiated peridium with variation in the peridium only in pigmentation (darker near surface of fruitbody), 2) wide spores (some more than 3.5 microns at widest point) with 1 or very rarely 2 droplets, and 3) an association with Alnus rubra, A. incana, and A. rhombifolia. The characters of Alpova concolor include 1) a 2-layered peridium, 2) dermatocystidia (rare), 3) spores with 2-droplets, and 4) an association with Alnus rubra and A. rhombifolia. The characters of Alpova cinnamomeus include 1) a peridium reviving poorly and easily separated from the spore mass when revived, 2) relatively large gleba chambers with large buffer cells, 3) frequently 2 droplets in spores, and 4) an association with A. alnobetula and perhaps others. |The Alpova diplophloeus group are abundant among false truffles in the Pacific Northwest (Trappe(13)). |RANGE The Alpova diplophloeus group occur along Pacific Coast from CA to AK, and also known from moist habitats in Rocky Mountains, MI, NT, and NF, (Smith(4)). Collections were examined from BC, WA, OR, NF, NWT, AK, CA, CO, MI, UT, and WY, (Trappe(11)). The group are abundant in the Pacific Northwest, found from BC south to northern CA and east to the east coast, also in Europe, (Trappe(13)). They are frequent on foray lists for BC and collections from BC are at Pacific Forestry Centre and the University of British Columbia.

NOTES  Arcangeliella tenax is a sequestrate Lactarius; characterized by relatively large size of fruiting body, pale buff color, white unchanging latex, spore mass gill-like but convoluted to lacunose, poorly developed stem, peppery taste, and spores that have a strongly amyloid ornamentation and a smooth plage, (Thiers(4))^; Arora describes A. tenax and A. lactarioides as very similar to if not the same as A. crassa; Smith(24) described this species from Mt. Hood, OR; Thiers(4) in 1979 gives a description of the species from CA, but Thiers(6) in 1984 gives Arcangeliella tenax A.H. Sm. & Wiebe as a synonym of Arcangeliella crassa Singer & A.H.

NAME ORIGIN  from tenax = tenacious (Latin)
SIMILAR  Lactarius crassus is similar but A. tenax differs in the sphaerocysts having walls thin enough to collapse readily, spores with higher ornamentation, and the plage is faintly ornamented (hence very weakly amyloid) as opposed to the plage in L. crassus which is covered by a mass of amyloid material, also L. crassus has a more distinctly cellular hymenium than G. tenax and the hymenophoral tissue when revived in KOH is not as tough, (Smith(24))

ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  Features include 1) a small, somewhat spherical, snow-white fruitbody that reddens to the touch when fresh and dries brown, 2) a brown spore mass with large cavities, 3) a sterile base, 4) a geranium odor, 5) underground growth, 6) spores that are warted apart from a smooth apex and that have a claw-like apiculus, and 7) 2-spored basidia.^ Bougher and Castellano moved Hymenogaster niveus Vittad. to Cortinomyces by virtue of its small warty spores, but they note that "predominance of a smooth spore apex and a cupped (claw-like) hilar appendix are not typical of other species of the genus. However, in the other Cortinomyces [italics] species a low proportion of spores with a torn or cupped hilar appendix do occur in some collections, and the ornamentation is sometimes reduced at the spore apex.", (Bougher). The online Species Fungorum, accessed February 9, 2019, gives the current name as Protoglossum niveum (Vittad.) T.W. May, Muelleria 8(3): 287 (1995), but MycoBank, accessed the same day, retains Cortinomyces niveus as the current name. It is not included in the Trappe(13) list of truffles from the Pacific Northwest. The description derived from Dodge(2). RANGE Collections were examined by Dodge(2) from OR, PQ, MI, Germany, Italy, and United Kingdom.

RANGE Elaphomyces muricatus has been reported from BC in Redhead(5), from WA by Jumpponen(1), from OR by Luoma(1), and from CA by Desjardin(6). It is found in the United Kingdom (Hawker(1)).
CHEMICAL REACTIONS  
OUTER SURFACE  2-5cm across, spherical to ovoid or somewhat lobed, very firm; ocher brown or yellow-brown; exterior "covered with minute hard pointed warts that give it a pimpled appearance", but these often hidden by crust of soil and mycorrhizal rootlets that is easy to brush away; peridium [skin] rind-like, firm and thick (0.2-0.5cm), "marbled when sectioned (dark brown to purplish brown with whitish to vinaceous-tinged veins)"
INNER LAYER  
INTERIOR  at first hollow, soon stuffed with cottony tissue, eventually becoming powdery when spores mature; white at first, soon grayish to purplish (and often separated into chambers by whitish sterile bands), finally becoming blackish and uniformly powdery^, (Arora), somewhat gooey when young, becoming a fine black powder (Trappe, M.(3))

SPORE DEPOSIT  
MICROSCOPIC  spores 18-30 x 18-30 microns, "round, warted or warted-spiny, dark brown to black under the microscope"^; asci "round to pear-shaped or irregular, mostly 8-spored, not forming a palisade (hymenium) and disintegrating soon after the spores form (and before they completely mature)"
NAME ORIGIN  means 'spiny like a murex' (a shellfish yielding a purple dye)
SIMILAR  Elaphomyces granulatus has a peridium that is not marbled in cross-section. Elaphomyces reticulatus is described as "Inner peridium obscurely marbled (in section), pale brown with whitish to pink veins; cortex mainly with flat warts", spores 19-28 microns in diameter with spines 2-2.5 microns long, whereas Elaphomyces muricatus is described as "Inner peridium distinctly marbled, dark reddish brown with pale brown veins; cortex mainly with pointed warts" and spores are 18-40 microns in diameter with spines 1.5-2.5 microns long, (Hansen, L.(1)). Scleroderma species usually have a distinct base or point of attachment, lack the small hard warts, usually grow closer to the surface or above it, and differ microscopically.

ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  The very large spores of Glomus macrocarpum measure 90-180 microns and are usually nearly round. They occur in clusters in soil or in fruitbodies up to 1.2cm wide. Fruitbodies are irregularly spherical to ellipsoid and beige to brown, with or without a white, cottony peridium that collapses when touched.^ Trappe(8) corrected the Latin ending to neuter, because Glomus is a neuter noun despite its ending. Gerdemann(1) examined "large-spored" collections of the type variety with spores often exceeding 150 microns in diameter (ranging up to 230 microns), and "small-pored" collections with spores ranging from 50-150 microns. Berch(2) recombined as separate Glomus species three of the synonyms given by Gerdemann(1): E. versiforme Karst. (here considered Diversispora versiformis, see SIMILAR), E. tenebrosa Thaxter, and E. australis Berk. As a result the spore size ranges only up to 140 microns. Gerdemann(1) also examined collections from Washington, Oregon, and California of var. geosporus, which is distinguished from the type variety "in not forming sporocarps, in its very dark spore walls, and in the long extension of wall thickening along the spore-bearing hyphae", (Gerdemann) but this has subsequently been raised to species status as Glomus geosporum (T.H. Nicolson & Gerd.) Walker. At least in the wide sense G. macrocarpum is abundant among false truffles in the Pacific Northwest and locally common worldwide, and forms arbuscular mycorrhizae with many plants, (Trappe(13)). RANGE The "large-spored" collections examined by Gerdemann(1) came from CA, and the "small-spored" from BC, WA, OR, CA; they said that the species is widely distributed over much of the world.

ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  Features include 1) a spherical to lobed minutely velvety fruitbody that is whitish to yellowish or brownish, 2) an interior varying from a simple cavity with a prominent opening to a very convoluted interior, whitish at first but the fertile tissue often brownish to pinkish orange at maturity, 3) growth in soil or inside very rotten wood, and 4) microscopic characters including elliptic spores that are pitted and wrinkled, borne on typically 8-spored asci.^ Var. variiformis is orange brown, and var. pallida is white to cream when young and pale, dull orange when fully mature, (Trappe, M.(3)). Hydnotrya variiformis is common among truffles in the Pacific Northwest (Trappe(13)). RANGE It is found from southern BC to northern CA and the Rocky Mountains, (Trappe(13)). It has been reported frequently from OR to the Oregon Truffling Society. It was reported from WA by Jumpponen(1), from OR by J. Smith et al., from WY by Fogel(7), and given for OR, CA, and WY by Gilkey(3). There are collections from BC at the Pacific Forestry Centre and the University of British Columbia.

SPORE DEPOSIT  
MICROSCOPIC  spores "32-36 x 24-28 microns, elliptical, smooth becoming minutely pitted and wrinkled at maturity, yellowish-brown under the microscope"^, non-amyloid asci in palisade that lines the canals or cavity, typically 8 spored, (Arora), spores 32-36 x 24-28 microns, elliptic, minutely and irregularly lacunose-rugose, yellow-brown, uniseriate when mature; asci 240-280 microns long, somewhat clavate at first, becoming cylindric; paraphyses 6 microns wide, extending 120-140 microns beyond asci, slightly enlarged at tip; cortex pseudoparenchymatous without, changing to "intertwined, branching hyphae running perpendicular to asci", (Gilkey(2)), 25-30 x 10-15 microns, elliptic, "colorless to pale yellow and enclosed in an amorphous sheath decorated with scattered, tiny pits", (Trappe, M.(3) for var. pallida)
NAME ORIGIN  from Latin "vari-" meaning "variable" and "-formis" meaning "form", for its highly variable shaped, (Trappe, M.(1))
SIMILAR  Hydnotrya cerebriformis is similar in having a complex or convoluted interior (at least in large specimens), fondness for growing inside rotten wood, and non-amyloid asci, but H. cerebriformis has a more consistently complex or convoluted interior (not unlike Geopora cooperi), is usually slightly darker (dull reddish-brown to purple-brown), typically has a strong garlicky odor when mature, and has round minutely spiny spores. Geopora cooperi has a fuzzy exterior. Genabea cerebriformis has warts.

NOTES  Features include 1) an irregular, dingy white fruitbody that becomes brown and has a smooth to flocculent surface that is soon checked or cracked, 2) a spore mass that is firm, watery, and brown, 3) underground growth under oak in spring, and 4) microscopic characters including elliptic to spindle-shaped spores that are dark brown and warty-wrinkled with distinct longitudinal folds, the basidia 2-spored and 4-spored.^ Smith regards Zeller 8466 as being this species, and describes it along with the type because of the incomplete information available from the type, saying, "The spores are not as conspicuously ornamented as in the type but in this group (the large spored species) I hesitate to emphasize the difference. Zeller's collection was made from under maple in May at Comstock, Oregon. This habitat and the vernal fruiting period are consistent with the type." (Smith(27)). Because of the uncertainty, both microscopic descriptions are used here. It is infrequent among false truffles in the Pacific Northwest (Trappe(13)).

NOTES  Features include 1) a somewhat spherical to irregularly lobed, white fruitbody that is gradually tinged lilac to dingy blue on exposure or bruising, and becomes yellowish, the blue color often disappearing with maturity, 2) a spore mass that is white becoming brown at maturity, 3) columella absent or more often as a sterile basal patch with a few branches, 4) attachment by rhizomorphs scattered over surface, 5) underground growth under mountain conifers, and 6) microscopic characters including small non-beaked warty-wrinkled spores on 4-spored basidia.^ Arora says "This species appears to be the most common conifer-loving Hymenogaster, at least in California. The confusing color changes it undergoes as it ages and dries out has led to the naming of several "new" species (e.g. H. brunnescens, H. diabolus, H. subochraceus) where only one exists." Fogel(2) synonymized H. brunnescens A.H. Sm., H. diabolus A.H. Sm., H. subcaeruleus A.H. Sm., H. subochraceus A.H. Sm., and H. subolivaceus A.H. Sm. with this species. Descriptions derived both from Fogel's wide concept and from the original Smith description are given below. Most Hymenogaster species are related to Hebeloma, but this species is related to Cortinarius and will need a new name, (Trappe(13)). Trappe(13) informally use the name "Protoglossum" for this species, but seems not to recognize the combination Protoglossum aromaticum (Velen.) Vidal. In Vidal(1) the new combination has the same synonyms as Fogel's concept plus Hymenogaster remyi C.W. Dodge & Zeller and Rhizopogonella haasii Sochner. Hymenogaster sublilacinus is common among false truffles in the Pacific Northwest (Trappe(13)). Arora(1) calls it "fairly common in the Sierra Nevada and other mountain ranges of the West in the spring, summer, and early fall". RANGE It is found from WA to southern CA and east to ID, (Trappe(13)). It was described from ID. Fogel(2) examined collections from WA, OR, ID, AZ, CA, CO, MT, NV, UT, and WY.

ENGLISH NAMES  gastroid Coprinus
NOTES  Also listed in Gilled category. Montagnea arenaria is at first deeply buried and enclosed in a tough membrane, then expands as the ruptured outer skin forms a volva at the base of the stem. The mature fruiting body has a stem and a cap (all but the cap disc (cap center) soon splitting into spore-bearing plates).^ The online Species Fungorum, accessed December 15, 2015, gave the name as Montagnea arenaria (DC.) Zeller as above, and it would seem that the Latin word 'arenarius' meaning 'sandy' should agree with the ending of the genus named after Montagne, but Zeller called it Montagnea arenarius when combining the name in 1943. The description is derived from Arora(1). RANGE Arora(1) mentions distribution in the arid and semi-arid parts of western North America (from Mexico and TX to CA, OR, and eastern WA).

SIMILAR  Gyrophragmium californicum is similar but rarer, (known from the San Francisco Bay area in California), and has dark brown to blackish spore-bearing plates that hang from the underside of the disc-like cap rather than from the margin. It also has a loose volva plus a double-layered partial veil that either disappears or forms an annulus (ring). (Arora(1)). A Gyrophragmium species has been reported from Washington state, (Lorelei Norvell, pers. comm.): instead of having spore bearing plates that hang from the edge of the cap, the plates hang from the underside of the cap.

ENGLISH NAMES  desert shaggy-mane, desert inky-cap, false shaggy-mane, khumbi
NOTES  Also listed in Gilled category. Podaxis pistillaris is similar to Coprinus comatus but has a contorted plated spore mass in place of true gills, and grows in arid areas.^ Some put Podaxis into an order of its own, Podaxales (because of the presence of capillitium), while others consider it a gastroid relative of Coprinus. Khumbi is a name used in India also for Phellorina inquinans, where the two species are the most popular edible commercial mushrooms in the market, (McKnight). It survives its desert habitat by means of thick-walled spores (Lincoff). The description is derived from Arora(1) except where indicated. It is the most prominent desert fungus of the western US, and occurs in warm dry areas on all continents, (Arora). RANGE Distribution is CA to southern ID, south to Mexico, and east to TX, (McKnight). The University of Washington has collections from CA, AZ, NM, TX, and Australia.

NOTES  Rhizopogon ater is distinctive for its black exterior and spore mass, whether fresh or dry, the color arising from deposits of black, granular crystals in its tissues. When young the outer surface is sordid white to gray under a thin layer of brown hyphae, and often stains pink to vinaceous or brown, by maturity becoming blackish. The inner peridium is sometimes pink. The spore mass is gray to dirty olive, soon becoming black. A columella is rare but there are rhizomorphs at the base.^ The description is derived from Grubisha(3) except where noted. It is infrequent among false truffles in the Pacific Northwest (Trappe(13)). RANGE Rhizopogon ater is associated with Douglas-fir stands from near sea level to about 600 m elevation in the northern OR Coast Ranges and rarely in the southern WA Cascades, (Grubisha).

ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  Features include 1) a spherical to irregular fruitbody with a dry, fibrillose surface that is pallid, darkening to wood brown or dull cinnamon brown, 2) a spore mass that is pallid then olivaceous, 3) clustered-gregarious growth under Pinus contorta, 4) smooth, narrow spores from 6-spored and 8-spored basidia, and 5) a poorly developed epicuticular layer of the peridium with thick-walled hyphae, knee-joint-like cells, and spherical cells. Its status as an independent species is disputed.^ Molecular evidence has been presented to support the contention that R. colossus var. colossus (or at least two paratypes that were studied) is a synonym (along with R. parksii holotype and R. hawkerae paratype) of R. villosulus A.H. Sm. (Martin, M.P.(2)); on the other hand, other molecular evidence suggests that R. colossus (holotype), R. villosulus (a different collection), R. hawkerae (same paratype), and R. villescens (non-type) are close and could be a single species that shows variation, whereas two non-type collections of R. parksii were more distant, (Grubisha(2)). The description is for var. colossus: in var. nigromaculatus fresh fruiting bodies turn black when handled, although the dried fruitbodies are indistinguishable. Rhizopogon colossus is not included in the Trappe(13) list of (true and false) truffles of the Pacific Northwest. RANGE Collections were examined from WA, OR, ID, CA, for var. colossus, and WA for var. nigromaculatus, (Smith(30)). Var. nigromaculatus was found in NM(Harrison(2)).

LATIN NAMES  Rhizopogon hawkerae  A.H. Sm.^  Mem. N.Y. Bot. Gard. 14: 83. 1966
ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  Features include 1) a spherical to irregular fruitbody with a surface that has wood brown fibrils over a whitish ground color, and changes to bright pink where injured, 2) a spore mass that is white when young, becoming olive, 3) growth in very rotten wood, 4) an olive reaction of the peridial surface to KOH and FeSO4, and 5) microscopic characters including narrowly elliptic spores from 4-6-spored basidia, rare to scattered cystidia, and peridial epicutis with versiform cells 2-11 microns wide, many seta-like cells (flagellate hyphal ends).^ Molecular evidence has been presented to support the contention that Rhizopogon hawkerae (or at least a paratype and other collections identified as this species) is a synonym (along with R. parksii and paratypes of R. colossus var. colossus) of R. villosulus A.H. Sm. (Martin, M.P.(2)); on the other hand, other molecular evidence suggests that R. villosulus (different collection), R. colossus (holotype), R. hawkerae (same paratype), and R. villescens (non-type) are close and could be a single species that shows variation, whereas two non-type collections of R. parksii were more distant, (Grubisha(2)). Rhizopogon hawkerae is abundant among false truffles in the Pacific Northwest (Trappe(13)). RANGE It is found from southern BC to northern CA and ID, (Trappe(13)). It has been reported to the North American Truffling Society for OR and for Sproat Lake in BC. It was reported from OR by J. Smith et al. A specimen from WA was used in study (Grubisha(2)).

NAME ORIGIN  after Lilian Hawker who found the type
SIMILAR  Rhizopogon subareolatus and Rhizopogon villosulus are similar Douglas-fir associated species that also have woven brown walled hyphae in the peridium revived in KOH: R. subareolatus has slightly smaller spores 6-7 x 2-2.3 microns, and no flagellate hyphae and R. villosulus lacks a red layer in the subcutis as revived in KOH (may be orange-brown). Beside those two, other species associated with Douglas-fir that have woven brown hyphae in the peridium revived in KOH include Rhizopogon parksii (spores 4.5-6.5 x 2.3-3 microns), Rhizopogon villescens (spores 7-10 x 3-4 microns), Rhizopogon zelleri (spores 9-12 x 3.5-4 microns), (these three like R. hawkerae with at least some flagellate hyphae), Rhizopogon vinicolor (spores 5.5-8 x 3-4.5 microns), and Rhizopogon subclavatisporus (spores 8-13 x 4.5-7 microns and thicker on one end), (NATS). Rhizopogon mutabilis A.H. Sm., found in ID, may be this species. See also SIMILAR section of Rhizopogon colossus and Rhizopogon subclavitisporus.

ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  Rhizopogon olivaceotinctus is characterized by the combination of a sticky gelatinous spore mass with gel-filled locules, a yellow-brown peridium, and basidiospores that measure (6)8-10(12) x 3-4(5) microns, (Castellano). The spore mass is mottled yellow-brown with white streaks and exudes a latex when cut. There is an association with Abies (true fir).^ The species was included in the genus Alpova for many years but in 2001, Grubisha(1) presented molecular evidence that it is not close to the other Alpova species and should be returned to Rhizopogon. It is infrequent among false truffles in the Pacific Northwest (Trappe(13)). RANGE Rhizopogon olivaceotinctus is found from southwestern OR to southern CA, (Trappe(13)). It is found in southern OR and northern CA (Castellano).

NOTES  Features include 1) a nearly spherical to irregular fruitbody with a surface that has an overlay of dark fibrils but is pallid becoming dark brown, 2) a pinkish layer (exposed by separation of the outer layer) that soon stains blue and finally umber, (the bruising reaction also described as pink to violet), 3) an olive spore mass, 4) an inky fuscous KOH reaction on the fresh surface of the fruitbody, 5) a slowly dark olive FeSO4 reaction on the fresh surface, 6) growth in duff under Douglas-fir and Sitka spruce, and 7) microscopic characters including relatively short spores, a peridium with flagellate hyphal ends, and a peridial subcutis that is a thick layer reddish in KOH on revived material.^ Molecular evidence has been presented to support the contention that R. parksii (the holotype) is a synonym (along with a R. hawkerae paratype and R. colossus var. colossus paratypes) of R. villosulus A.H. Sm. (Martin, M.P.(2)). On the other hand, other molecular evidence suggests that R. villosulus (a different collection), R. colossus (the holotype), R. hawkerae (the same paratype), and R. villescens (non-type) are close and could be a single species that shows variation, whereas two non-type collections of R. parksii were more distant, (Grubisha(2)). Rhizopogon parksii is abundant among false truffles in the Pacific Northwest (Trappe(13)). RANGE Rhizopogon parksii, using the Smith & Zeller(1966) concept, is found in WA, OR, and CA and is the most abundant Rhizopogon in the Sitka spruce zone along the coast, (Smith(4)). R. parksii occurs from southwestern BC to northern CA and ID, (Trappe(13) who list also Rhizopogon villosulus, R. villescens, and R. hawkerae, but not R. colossus). R. parksii is known from hundreds of locations in BC, western WA, western OR, and northern CA, (Castellano(1)).

NOTES  Features include 1) a spherical to angular fruitbody that is white becoming yellowish and taking on reddish brown color when bruised, the surface cottony-fibrillose to felt-like or areolate [cracked like dried mud], 2) rhizomorphs on the surface, 3) a white spore mass that becomes olive brown, 4) chemical characters, and 5) microscopic characters including minutely punctate spores from 4-spored, 6-spored, and 8-spored basidia, and peridial hyphae heavily incrusted with amorphous reddish brown intracellular and intercellular pigment.^ |S.L. Miller distinguishes Rhizopogon rubescens from similar species in the southeastern United States with yellowish color and reddish bruising reaction (including R. abietis and R. vulgaris) by accepting only collections with "a pale yellow fresh peridium that is soon mottled with large patches of red or reddish brown, and becomes areolate in age", (Miller, S.L.(1)). |The online Species Fungorum, accessed May 23, 2016, gave this name as a synonym of Rhizopogon roseolus (Corda) Th. Fr.; Svrcek also regarded R. rubescens as a synonym of R. roseolus, (as do Trappe, M.(3), and presumably Trappe(13) who do not list R. rubescens while calling R. roseolus abundant in the Pacific Northwest). |But Smith & Zeller do not accept the synonymy because there is no mention in Corda's description of yellow colors in the description of R. roseolus, (Smith(30)). |Smith(30) describes three additional varieties whose spores are seldom over 3.5 microns wide: 1) var. pallidimaculatus (from ID, MI) has a dried spore mass showing pale yellowish streaks and spots, and fresh specimens have a fragrant odor, 2) var. ochraceus (from ID) not with the characters given for var. pallidimaculatus, spores capsule-shaped, 7-9 x 3-3.5 microns, and 3) var. rileyi (from ID) not with the characters given for var. pallidimaculatus, spores oblong to subfusoid, 6.5-8 x 2.5-3 microns. |Rhizopogon rubescens is known from across the North American continent and is probably the commonest Rhizopogon in North America, (Smith(4)). It is "often very abundant in lodgepole pine forests of our Rocky Mountains in late July and August, but known across the continent", (Smith(30)). |RANGE Collections were examined from PQ, MI, TN, VA, and France, (Miller, S.L.).

NAME ORIGIN  means 'becoming red'
SIMILAR  Rhizopogon roseolus and Rhizopogon albiroseus lack yellow at all times in development, (Smith(4)) (but multiple authors consider R. rubescens a synonym of R. roseolus). Rhizopogon abietis has larger spores, more inflated cells in the peridium, and usually much larger paraphyses, (Smith(30)). Rhizopogon ventricosporus has larger spores, (Smith(30)). Rhizopogon vulgaris gives a strong FeSO4 reaction, has narrower spores 5.5-8 x 2-2.6 microns, lacks cystidia, and has thin-walled paraphyses, (Smith(30)). Rhizopogon subcitrinus is smaller and when dried has a bone-hard consistency, (Smith(30)). Rhizopogon occidentalis does not become red (unless cut) or dark brown, but tends to retain the bright yellow surface color, and when bruised may turn yellow to orange to reddish brown, (Smith(30)). Rhizopogon vinicolor is associated with Douglas-fir, has brown woven hyphae in the peridium, and has tramal hyphae with an ice-like or glass-like appearance, (Trappe, M.). Rhizopogon evadens var. evadens has a fresh peridium that is white, yellowish brown to grayish orange, bruising instantly magenta, and spores (5.5)6-8 x 2.5-3(3.5) as opposed to a fresh mature peridium that is pale yellow, bruising red, when old mottled with large areas of brown or dark brown, and spores 7-10.5 x (2.5)3-3.5(4.5) microns for R. rubescens, (Miller, S.L.). R. evadens and Rhizopogon ochraceorubens bruise reddish, but have narrower spores. Rhizopogon ellenae is white when young and to late maturity, when handled slowly staining avellaneous to vinaceous fuscous. See also SIMILAR section of Rhizopogon pseudoroseolus.

NOTES  Rhizopogon smithii is recognized by 1) a nearly spherical to ovoid fruitbody that is pallid, quickly turning bright red with exposure or handling, the red stains changing to dingy brown, 2) a spore mass that is white becoming olive and sometimes staining ochraceous, with small chambers, 3) underground growth in sandy soil associated primarily with Pinus contorta, and 4) KOH and ethanol both giving a red reaction on fresh fruitbody surface, and FeSO4 reacting olive green to bluish green on the fresh surface.^ Hosford comments that a spotty but distinct yellow stage develops in the surface: the feature may be absent or overlooked, since the yellow phase is apparently transitory or, when present, often confined to small depressions or creases, (Hosford). The description is derived from Hosford(1). It is infrequent among false truffles in the Pacific Northwest (Trappe(13)). RANGE Rhizopogon smithii is found in western OR and northern CA, (Trappe(13)).

It was reported to North American Truffling Society for BC and frequently for OR. It was reported by Luoma(1) and Fogel(8) for OR. 2 paratypes of R. diabolicus A.H. Sm. from WA were subsumed under R. vinicolor sensu Kretzer et al., documenting the presence of R. vinicolor in Washington. It is found through much of the range of Douglas-fir in North America and introduced to Europe, Australia, and New Zealand on Douglas-fir seedlings on plantations, (Trappe, M.(1)). It is found from southwestern BC to northern CA, CO, (Trappe(13) who maintain separately Rhizopogon ochraceisporus A.H. Sm. as common in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho, under Pseudotsuga, and Rhizopogon diabolicus A.H. Sm. as rare in central Idaho under Pinaceae).

NAME ORIGIN  means 'wine-colored'
SIMILAR  Rhizopogon vesiculosus sensu Kretzer et al. differs from R. vinicolor sensu Kretzer most usefully in the colors of the fresh peridium (surface) and gleba (spore mass): 'Both species begin with a white peridium that bruises pinkish-red (Smith's "vinaceous"), but only R. vinicolor sensu Kretzer et al develops vivid yellow patches during early maturity. At maturity, both species are light yellowish brown (Smith's "ochraceous") and turn various shades of brown from handling, the shades typically reflecting the color of the mature gleba underneath (see below). In R. vinicolor sensu Kretzer et al, the gleba develops from white when immature through pale yellow and pale greenish yellow-brown, to dark greenish brown (Smith's "olive brown") or brown or more rarely reddish brown (Smith's "rusty cinnamon" or "russet"). On the other hand, the gleba of R. vesiculosus sensu Kretzer et al appears to develop from white to greenish brown (a stage that apparently is short and was not noted in the type description) to dark blackish-brown (dominant stage).', (Kretzer(1), Latin names italicized). Rhizopogon olivaceofuscus differs in its FeSO4 reaction and the change of color of the spore mass when cut. Rhizopogon parvulus has different spores (Smith(30)). In the dried state, Rhizopogon diabolicus has a bright rusty cinnamon spores mass and the peridium is less red, (Smith(30)). Other species associated with Douglas-fir that have woven brown hyphae in the peridium revived in KOH include R. parksii (spores 4.5-6.5 x 2.3-3 microns), Rhizopogon hawkerae (spores 6.5-8 x 2.2-2.8 microns), Rhizopogon villescens (spores 7-10 x 3-4 microns), Rhizopogon villosulus (spores 6-8 x 2.2.5 microns), Rhizopogon zelleri (spores 9-12 x 3.5-4 microns), (these five with at least some flagellate hyphae), Rhizopogon subareolatus (spores 6-7 x 2-2.3 microns), and Rhizopogon subclavatisporus (spores 8-13 x 4.5-7 microns and thicker on one end), (NATS). Rhizopogon rubescens is associated with pines, and the peridium has clear woven hyphae when revived in KOH, (NATS). Rhizopogon ellenae has spores 6-9 x 2.5-4 microns, and peridium when revived is thin (about 100 microns thick), shiny, and composed of woven hyphae but often with embedded debris, (NATS). Rhizopogon occidentalis, Rhizopogon ochraceorubens, Rhizopogon vulgaris, and Rhizopogon evadens may all become or bruise a shade of reddish but spores are narrower, (NATS). Rhizopogon gilkeyae A.H. Sm. and Rhizopogon subalpinus A.H. Sm. may be this species. See also SIMILAR section of Rhizopogon pachyspora and Rhizopogon subclavitisporus.

RANGE Collections were examined from OR, AR, CA, FL, MA, MS, TN, and VA, (Miller). Collections were examined from BC (although paraphyses were thick-walled), ID, NS, and TN, (Smith(30) saying that they are tentatively assigned here). It is found in ID (rare) according to Smith(4).

SIMILAR  Rhizopogon abietis is similar to fresh collections of R. vulgaris "in that both species are distinctly yellow, bruise red, and have a tangle of white rhizomorphs near the point of attachment", but in R. abietis spores are longer and wider and often have a knobby crooked apex, (Miller). Rhizopogon rubescens has wider spores, the FeSO4 reaction is weaker, paraphyses tend to become thick-walled, and cystidia may be present, (Smith(30)). Rhizopogon evadens lacks the distinctly yellow surface, and typically will bruise much faster and turns more magenta when young and fresh, (Miller). Rhizopogon defectus becomes vinaceous pink in some areas as dried, has a columella (in some basidiocarps at least), lacks a KOH color change of the fresh peridium, and has only a very weak to lacking FeSO4 reaction, (Smith(30)). Rhizopogon cusickiensis differs in the hymenial elements, (Smith(30)).

LATIN NAMES  Russula hunsuckeri  T.F. Elliott & Trappe^  Fungal Systematics and Evolution 1: 237. 2018;  == Macowanites nauseosus  A.H. Sm.  Mycologia 55: 428. 1963
ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  Also listed in Gilled category. Russula hunsuckeri is distinct from other sequestrate Russulas by a disagreeable taste, a vinaceous FeSO4 reaction on the cortex of the stem, nonreticulate spores, a peridium that has a strongly gelatinous ixotrichodermium with the terminal elements scarcely enlarged or actually narrowed, and pronounced development of sphaerocysts in the hymenophoral trama and the peridial context, the last feature being responsible for the almost crumbly flesh consistency. Other features include a dull reddish vinaceous, bald cap that is viscid to subviscid at first but soon dry, a somewhat gill-like spore mass that is pinkish buff to more ochraceous, a white, naked stem-columella that does not stain when handled, and broadly elliptic spores with strongly amyloid ornamentation, mostly as small blunt spines, separate or in groups or short rows, borne on 4-spored basidia.^ The description is derived from Smith(24). When the species was moved from Macowanites to Russula a new species epithet was required because of the prior name Russula nauseosa (Pers.) Fr.(1838). RANGE The holotype was found in ID.
CHEMICAL REACTIONS  FeSO4 causes stem cortex to become somewhat vinaceous

Russula subrosacea and Russula vilgalysii have yellow laticiferous hyphae in the peridial context, and different spores, (Smith).

LATIN NAMES  Schenella simplex  T. Macbr.^  Mycologia 3(1): 39. 1911;  Pyrenogaster atrogleba  (Zeller) L.S. Dominguez & Castellano  Mycologia 88(5)  866. 1996;  Radiigera atrogleba  Zeller
ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  Features include 1) a spherical to slightly flattened or depressed fruiting body often imbedded in white rhizomorphs, the rough outer surface whitish to grayish, often developing buff, pinkish, vinaceous, or brownish tints when old, 2) a peridium with a thin outer separable mycelial part and a thicker (0.3-0.5cm) inner part that is microscopically multilayered, 3) a spore mass that is white and soft, becoming sticky and blackish with a radial pattern, and finally black-powdery, 4) a conspicuous rounded columella in the middle of the spore mass, 5) clustered growth in soil or duff in woods (especially along roads in woods), and 6) microscopic characters including elliptic spores 5.6-7 x 4.2-5.5 microns, filiform 6-8-spored basidia, and specific peridial and glebal structures.^ Schenella simplex was originally thought to be a slime mold, but the name received priority when Radiigera atrogleba, described as a truffle, was later found to be the same species. In Schenella, dispersal by animals eating the fungus is supplemented by the development of spore-containing peridioles (radial sections of the spore mass) coated with a sticky substance, and in at least one species of the genus this enables parts of the spore mass to stick to the animal. It is abundant among false truffles in the Pacific Northwest (Trappe(13)). RANGE Schenella simplex is found from BC to northern CA, ID, and CO, (Trappe(13)). Collections were examined from BC, WA, OR, ID, CA, CO, and UT, and it is also known from MT and Mexico, (Dominguez).

NOTES  Truncocolumella citrina is characterized by 1) a spherical to irregular fruitbody that is yellowish to olive, dry, and smooth or sometimes cracking, 2) a small-chambered spore mass that is firm to gelatinous, and yellow-brown to olive-gray, 3) a yellow columella that is stump-like to branched, often forming a short thick stem, 4) growth in duff or slightly projecting, under Douglas-fir, and 5) microscopic details including elliptic, smooth spores from 4-spored basidia.^ Smith described the var. separabilis, distinguished by the tendency of the spore mass to separate from the stem-columella and from the plate-like branches of the columella, the distinct tubular nature of the spore mass, and the rather strong pseudoamyloid reaction of the spores in Melzer's reagent, and noted also an interwoven arrangement of the hyphae of the tramal plates. Truncocolumella citrina is abundant among false truffles in the Pacific Northwest (Trappe(13)). RANGE Truncocolumella citrina is found from BC to northern CA to the Rocky Mountains, (Trappe(13)).

ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  The underground fruitbodies are nearly spherical to irregularly lobed and furrowed, colored white to light grayish brown to yellowish brown or orange-brown with ivory to pale brown furrows and patches, the surface downy to scabrous, the interior solid, brown when mature, with white marbling veins. Odor is fruity-farinaceous becoming pungent and "truffly". Fruiting is known from October to June, under Douglas-fir. Four known species occur in the Tuber gibbosum complex, separated most reliably by the size and shape of the alveolate spores (also by molecular techniques): Tuber oregonense and T. bellisporum have narrow spores with those of the latter shorter, while Tuber gibbosum and T. castellanoi have wider spores with those of the latter shorter. Tuber bellisporum is characterized within the complex by narrow spores of medium length, and a mix in the peridium of pseudoparenchyma and prosenchyma. "Immature specimens of all four species may have poorly developed peridia with only scattered inflated cells and few or no one- and two-spored asci, so they often cannot be dependably separated at immature stages by morphology alone." (Bonito). [Even in mature specimens there is considerable variation in spore size and shape, and the size depends on how many spores are in the asci, making determination time-consuming.] Tuber gibbosum complex distinguished from other Tuber species by growth with Douglas-fir, relatively large size (when mature), tendency to develop cracks when old, and strong garlicky odor (when present). (Arora) The Tuber gibbosum complex is distinguished microscopically from other Tuber species in having the mature peridial suprapellis with "scattered to abundant tangled hyphae and hyphal tips" with walls irregularly thickened up to 2 microns in bands to produce a beaded appearance, these structures most evident at maturity. (Bonito) Tuber bellisporum is found west of Cascade Mountains from far southwestern WA south through western OR to northwestern CA at elevations from near sea level to about 500 m.

NAME ORIGIN  from Latin 'belli' meaning 'lovely' and '-sporum' meaning 'spored', "in reference to the attractive, tidy ornamentation of the spores", (Bonito)
SIMILAR  Tuber gibbosum has spores that on average are longer and wider, but "spore size might not always be useful in differentiating the two because of its high variability within and among specimens". T. gibbosum consistently has a pseudoparenchymatic pellis, whereas that of T. bellisporum has a mix of pseudoparenchyma and prosenchyma.

ENGLISH NAMES  
NOTES  The underground fruitbodies are spherical to irregularly lobed and furrowed, colored brownish white becoming dull brown with ivory to pale brown lines and patches, with surface that is minutely downy, the interior solid, and whitish to brown with white marbling veins. Fruiting is known from February to June and in December, usually under Douglas-fir.^ Four known species occur in the Tuber gibbosum complex, separated most reliably by the size and shape of the alveolate spores (also by molecular techniques): Tuber oregonense and T. bellisporum have narrow spores with those of the latter shorter, while Tuber gibbosum and T. castellanoi have wider spores with those of the latter shorter. Tuber castellanoi is characterized within the complex by shorter, round to broadly elliptic spores and a lower Q (length to width ratio, calculated by these authors using 40 spores in 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5- spored asci excluding ornamentation for at least 3 collections of each species). Peridial pellis is a variable pseudoparenchyma. "Immature specimens of all four species may have poorly developed peridia with only scattered inflated cells and few or no one- and two-spored asci, so they often cannot be dependably separated at immature stages by morphology alone." (Bonito). [Even in mature specimens there is considerable variation in spore size and shape, and the size depends on how many spores are in the asci, making determination time-consuming.] Tuber gibbosum complex is distinguished from other Tuber species by growth with Douglas-fir, relatively large size (when mature), tendency to develop cracks when old, and strong garlicky odor (when present). (Arora) The Tuber gibbosum complex is distinguished microscopically from other Tuber species in having the mature peridial suprapellis with "scattered to abundant tangled hyphae and hyphal tips" with walls irregularly thickened up to 2 microns in bands to produce a beaded appearance, these structures most evident at maturity. (Bonito) Tuber castellanoi is found west of the Cascade Mountains from southwestern WA south to southwestern OR to northwestern CA at elevations from near sea level to about 916 m and at one location in the northern Sierra Nevada at 1460 m.

NAME ORIGIN  
SIMILAR  Tuber whetstonensis is microscopically similar and also has thick-walled asci, but the peridium is scurfy and brown to reddish brown rather than distinctly verrucose and grayish to yellowish. (Trappe, J.). Tuber murinum Hesse of Europe is similar. J. Trappe initially concluded that T. gardneri was a synonym of T. murinum. The only notable difference between the two was color, T. murinum being more gray and T. gardneri more yellowish. After the molecular data began to show that N. America and Europe had a number of similar species that were actually genetically distinct, he decided it was prudent to separate the two pending molecular evidence, and for this reason he reverted to T. gardneri for the Pacific Northwest species. Older Pacific Northwest collections accessioned at Oregon State University may still be labeled T. murinum. (Trappe, J.). See also SIMILAR section of Tuber whetstonense.

ENGLISH NAMES  spring Oregon white truffle
NOTES  The underground fruitbodies are spherical to irregularly lobed and furrowed, colored pale olivaceous to olive brown to dull brown or orange-brown, the surface downy and often cracking, the interior solid, whitish to brown, with white marbling veins. Odor is mild soon becoming strong, pungent and complex, "truffly". Fruiting is known from January to June, under Douglas-fir. Microscopic features are important in differentiating T. gibbosum from other members of the T. gibbosum complex.^ Four known species occur in the Tuber gibbosum complex in the Pacific Northwest, separated most reliably by the size and shape of the alveolate spores (also by molecular techniques): Tuber oregonense and T. bellisporum have narrow spores with those of the latter shorter, while Tuber gibbosum and T. castellanoi have wider spores with those of the latter shorter. Tuber gibbosum is characterized within the complex by fairly wide elliptic spores of intermediate length, and a peridium of pseudoparenchymatic tissue. Of the four species only T. gibbosum forms a well-developed, epithelial pellis of large, inflated cells - "this is usually evident in fairly young specimens". "Immature specimens of all four species may have poorly developed peridia with only scattered inflated cells and few or no one- and two-spored asci, so they often cannot be dependably separated at immature stages by morphology alone." (Bonito). [Even in mature specimens there is considerable variation in spore size and shape, and the size depends on how many spores are in the asci, making determination time-consuming.] The Tuber gibbosum complex is distinguished from other Tuber species by growth with Douglas-fir, relatively large size (when mature), a tendency to develop cracks when old, and a strong garlicky odor (when present), (Arora).

NAME ORIGIN  means 'protuberant, humped, crooked'
SIMILAR  Tuber oregonense has long, narrow spores common in 1-spored to 4-spored asci, and generally taller spore ornamentation - the largest spores are subfusoid with length to width ratio Q up to 2.9 and reticulate ornamentation mostly 5-7(8) microns tall (T. gibbosum has only elliptic spores with Q no more than 1.45 and reticulum 3-5(6) microns tall.) The peridium of T. oregonense has a prosenchymatous structure (pseudoparenchymatic in T. gibbosum). Fruiting for T. oregonense is September to mid-March and for T. gibbosum January to June. (Bonito). Tuber oregonense 1) does not have a thin, almost translucent peridium like T. gibbosum, 2) has more reddish orange tones as it matures than T. gibbosum, 3) fruits in October through February whereas Tuber gibbosum fruits in January through June, and 4) differs microscopically in the size and shape of the spores and the anatomy of the peridium, (Trappe, M.(3)). T. bellisporum has spores that are on average shorter and narrower but "spore size might not always be useful in differentiating the two because of its high variability within and among specimens". T. gibbosum consistently has a pseudoparenchymatic pellis, whereas that of T. bellisporum has a mix of pseudoparenchyma and prosenchyma. "Several peridial cross sections are needed to confirm which peridial type occurs on a single specimen". (Bonito). Tuber castellanoi has shorter spores (Bonito).

ENGLISH NAMES  fall Oregon white truffle
NOTES  Underground fruitbodies are spherical to irregular, furrowed, white becoming orange-brown to reddish brown, the surface roughened-bald to minutely downy, when old often cracking. The interior is solid, white to brown with white marbling veins. Odor is mild, soon becoming pungent and complex (garlic, spices, cheese, and indefinable other essences). Fruiting is from fall to winter.^ Four known species occur in the Tuber gibbosum complex, separated most reliably by the size and shape of the alveolate spores (also by molecular techniques): Tuber oregonense and T. bellisporum have narrow spores with those of the latter shorter, while Tuber gibbosum and T. castellanoi have wider spores with those of the latter shorter. Tuber oregonense is characterized within the complex by its long narrow spores common in 1- to 4-spored asci (subfusoid in the largest spores), its generally taller spore ornamentation, and its generally prosenchymatous peridial pellis. "Immature specimens of all four species may have poorly developed peridia with only scattered inflated cells and few or no one- and two-spored asci, so they often cannot be dependably separated at immature stages by morphology alone." Tuber oregonense fruits primarily in fall to early winter and is the most commonly collected Tuber species in the fall in the Pacific Northwest. (Bonito). [Even in mature specimens there is considerable variation in spore size and shape, and the size depends on how many spores are in the asci, making determination time-consuming.] Tuber gibbosum complex distinguished from other Tuber species by growth with Douglas-fir, relatively large size (when mature), tendency to develop cracks when old, and strong garlicky odor (when present). (Arora) The Tuber gibbosum complex is distinguished microscopically from other Tuber species in having the mature peridial suprapellis with "scattered to abundant tangled hyphae and hyphal tips" with walls irregularly thickened up to 2 microns in bands to produce a beaded appearance, these structures most evident at maturity. (Bonito) RANGE Tuber oregonense is found west of Cascade Mountains from southern Puget Sound of WA south to southwestern OR. (Bonito), and Beug(3) gives the range as BC to CA. Berch(4) lists two fruitbody collections from BC.

SIMILAR  Tuber gibbosum fruits from fall through winter to early summer, and has spores with a lower length to width ratio (wider and somewhat shorter): the largest spores of T. oregonense are subfusoid with Q up to 2.9 and a reticulate ornamentation mostly 5-7(8) microns tall, whereas T. gibbosum has only elliptic spores with Q no larger than 1.45 and a reticulum 3-5(6) microns tall, (Bonito). T. gibbosum differs in having a peridium that appears almost translucent, and if reddish tones are present they are less prominent than in Tuber oregonense. It also differs in fruiting season, the anatomy of the peridium, and spore size and shape. (Trappe, M.). Tuber gibbosum "occurs in the same habitats ... but fruits during later winter and spring ... it also differs in its almost translucent peridium, and less of a tendency to develop reddish colors in age." (Trudell). Tuber bellisporum has shorter spores, (Bonito). Tuber castellanoi has shorter wider spores, (Bonito).
